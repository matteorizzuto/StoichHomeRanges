## Data Loading and Cleaning
Over the course of four years, from 2016 to 2019, our research group 
live-trapped, collared, and followed 38 snowshoe hares over four sampling grids. 
These are, from younger (20--40 years old) to oldest (81--100 years old): 
Bloomfield (n=35), Unicorn (n=1), Terra Nova North (n=1), and Dunphy's Pond 
(n=1). As the bulk of individuals followed was found in the Bloomfield grid, we 
will focus on this population of hares. Each year, live trapping occurred in the 
spring and fall seasons, whereas triangulation took place during the summer 
months (i.e., May-September). Triangulation started in 2017. See the main text 
and Supplementary Information for details on animal handling and live trapping 
protocols and permits. 

<!-- Throughout each data collection season, some collared snowshoe hares died. In -->
<!-- some cases, this happened before we had a chance to collect enough relocations -->
<!-- for producing a reliable estimate of these individuals' home ranges. Because of -->
<!-- this, we removed these individuals from analyses (n=5). -->

Here, we begin by loading the datasets containing the triangulation data, one 
per year, and the dataset containing the live-trapping and demographic data.
```{r data-loading, error=TRUE,tidy=TRUE}
# Load the triangulation raw data
rawData17 <- read.csv("../Data/VHF_CleanData_2017.csv", header = TRUE) # 2017
rawData18 <- read.csv("../Data/VHF_CleanData_2018.csv", header = TRUE) # 2018
rawData19 <- read.csv("../Data/TelemetryPoints_VHF_2019.csv", 
                      header = TRUE) # 2019

# Switch back to VHF_CleanData_2019.csv to run with data pre Bella's corrections 
# from Dec 2019

# Load hare trapping and demographic data, this contains the eartag number
# which allows us to track if individuals survived multiple years
hareDemData <- read.csv("../Data/CollaredHareData.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# make sure Collar Frequency and SamplingYear are factors
hareDemData$CollarFrequency <- as.factor(hareDemData$CollarFrequency)
hareDemData$SamplingYear <- as.factor(hareDemData$SamplingYear)


# load the spatial layout of our sampling grids
grid_points_all <- read_sf(dsn = "../Data/GridPoints", 
                           layer = "GridPts_withFRI")

# subset the Bloomfield grid, which we will use as a visual reference
# for the position of our grid in space
bl_grid_points <- subset(grid_points_all, 
                         grid_points_all$SiteName == "Bloomfield")

# Load the StDMs raster layers
acruCN <- raster("../Data/StDMs_Rasters/Ratios/ACRU_CN.tif")

### Caveats 
The 2019 triangulation data were collected using decimal coordinates, whereas 
for the 2017 and 2018 triangulation data we used UTM coordinates. The following 
code chunk (source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/18641016) takes care of this 
discrepancy by converting decimal Latitude and Longitude to UTM format. 
The UTM zone number for our study site is 22.

```{r UTM-conversion, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# # assign UTM-format names to spatial coordinates in rawData19
# coordinates(rawData19) <- c("Easting", "Northing")
# # set projection for rawData19
# proj4string(rawData19) <- CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")
# 
# # transform rawData19 to a SpatialPointsDataFrame, this is the step that 
# # performs the actual conversion from decimal Latitude and Longitude coordinates
# # to UTM coordinates
# rawData19 <- spTransform(rawData19, CRS("+proj=utm +zone=22 ellps=WGS84"))
# 
# # convert rawData19 back to a normal dataframe
# rawData19 <- as.data.frame(rawData19)
# # set UTM zone
# rawData19$UTMZone <- as.integer(22)
```

```{r rawdata-crs-conversion,echo=TRUE,tidy=TRUE}
# 2019 uses lat/long and 2017-2018 use UTM
# convert all of them to meters to match stoich raster CRS
# code developed by Isabella C. Richmond (https://gitlab.com/icrichmond/)
# note that ICR uses the notation "VHFXXXX" to name the telemetry datasets, 
# where XXXX is the year of sampling in its 4 digits notation 
 
rawData17 <- drop_na(rawData17, Easting)
coordinates(rawData17) <- c("Easting", "Northing")
proj4string(rawData17) <- CRS("+init=epsg:32622")

rawData17 <- spTransform(rawData17, CRS("+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=-61.5 +k=0.9999 +x_0=304800 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +units=m +no_defs"))
rawData17 <- as.data.frame(rawData17)
rawData17$UTMZone <- as.integer(22)

rawData18 <- as.data.frame(rawData18)
rawData18$UTMZone <- as.integer(22)


coordinates(rawData19) <- c("Easting", "Northing")

rawData19 <- as.data.frame(rawData19)
rawData19$UTMZone <- as.integer(22)
```


We will not be using several variables we collected in the field in the following 
analyses. These include:

* **Notes**, which contained general comments and notes about relocations collected in the field
* **SampleTimeCat**, **SampleTimeGeneral**, and **TimeCategory**, which we created to categorize
the time of triangulation: in the final dataset, variable AM_PM has taken over their function
* **Clouds** and **Temperature** (Temp, Temp_C), were collected in different ways between 2017--2018 and 2019, due to differences in the sampling equipment, and hence they cannot be used for analyses that take into account all three years
* **Line**, which identifies the lines drawn on the iPad along a bearing collected during triangulation, provide information which is redundant with the Point variable
* **Fix.Location**, which is redundant with the UTM coordinates of the listening points and
is used for convenience in the field
* **Time_O**, which is redundant as no script uses the original time in HH:MM:SS but all
use time in HHMMSS stored in variable Time
* **Alive**, which was collected to keep track of the live collars on the grid during data
collection but is never used in the scripts

Finally, in summer 2017, the main observer (MR) had health issues that prevented
him from performing data collection for a period of three days. During this 
time, a second observer (TH) performed triangulations, to check whether the 
collared animals were alive. As these relocations covered a limited period of 
time, and for lack of an assessment of the intra-observer variability in 
triangulation skills, we exclude these relocations from all analyses.

## Telemetry Error Analyses
In 2017, a single observer performed all triangulations on the four 
radio-collared snowshoe hares active on our trapping grid. In 2018 and 2019,due 
to an increase in both the number of collared hares active on the grid and in 
the workforce available, we had three observer simultaneously collecting 
azimuths on each collar. This approach allowed for a faster completion time for
each triangulation bout and also for an improve accuracy. 

Here, we report the data and code used to estimate the accuracy of our lone
observer in 2017 (MR) and of one of the observers in 2018 (Mr. Benjamin Stratton).
During the lead-up to the 2017 and 2018 telemetry sampling seasons, we conducted 
6 days of error reduction exercises with MR in 2017, and 7 days of error 
reduction exercises with BS in 2018. During each error reduction session, the
observer would attempt to locate a variable number of collars (range: 1-7) 
hidden in advance by a collaborator. In 2017, these exercises took place on the
trapping grid itself, alongside other sampling activities. In 2018, exercises 
took place in Pippy Park, a large natural area in St. John's, NL, whose
vegetation and topography closely resemble the grid itself.

# remove trials for which we are missing true locations
trials.triangd_sp <- subset(trials.triangd_sp, trials.triangd_sp$TrueLoc != "No")
```

Now that all error trials have been triangulated, we can estimate the distance
between a collar's true location and the location estimated from MR's or BS's
triangulation efforts. We use function `st_distance` from package `sf` to measure 
the distance then, for each observer, we extract mean, median, minimum, and
maximum error, as well as the standard deviation.

```{r error-reduction-dist, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# load dataset with true locations of test collars
trueLocs_raw <- read.csv("../Data/ErrorTrials_TrueLocs.csv")

trueLocs_raw$TrueLoc <- as.factor(trueLocs_raw$TrueLoc)

# turn it into a spatial object
trueLocs <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords = trueLocs_raw[, c("Easting", "Northing")], data = trueLocs_raw[, c(1:2, 6:7)], proj4string = CRS("+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=-61.5 +k=0.9999 +x_0=304800 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +units=m +no_defs"))

# turn it into a sf object to use st_distance to calculate distance between tests 
# and true locs
trueLocs_sp <- st_as_sf(trueLocs) %>% rename(., Frequency = Collar) %>% arrange(., Date, Frequency)

trueLocs_sp <- subset(trueLocs_sp, trueLocs_sp$TrueLoc != "No")

# now, measure the distance in meters, between trials and true locations
trials.triangd_sp$Error <- as.numeric(st_distance(trials.triangd_sp, trueLocs_sp, by_element = TRUE))

# and get a mean value
err_mean <- with(trials.triangd_sp, tapply(trials.triangd_sp$Error, trials.triangd_sp$Observer, mean))
err_sd <- with(trials.triangd_sp, tapply(trials.triangd_sp$Error, trials.triangd_sp$Observer, sd))
err_min <- with(trials.triangd_sp, tapply(trials.triangd_sp$Error, trials.triangd_sp$Observer, min))
err_max <- with(trials.triangd_sp, tapply(trials.triangd_sp$Error, trials.triangd_sp$Observer, max))
err_median <- with(trials.triangd_sp, tapply(trials.triangd_sp$Error, trials.triangd_sp$Observer, median))


# remove temporary object that will be used later on

# rm(list = c("IDs", "UniqIDs", "TmpInds", "TmpData", "current.triang", 
#             "current.triang.dat", "current.triang.index", "current.triang.int", 
#             "current.triang.loc", "workingCollar.coords", "workingCollar.loc", 
#             "workingCollar.spatial", "date"))
```

Thus, according to our analyses, the mean error for MR in 2017 was 
**`r prettyNum(err_mean[2], digits = 3)` $\pm$ `r prettyNum(err_sd[2], digits = 3)`** m, whereas for BS in 2018 it was 
**`r prettyNum(err_mean[1], digits = 3)` $\pm$ `r prettyNum(err_sd[1], digits = 3)`** m.

## Snowshoe hare dataset preparation
After cleaning the three triangulation data sets following the caveats listed 
above, we merge them into one, called `liveData`. 

```{r data-cleanup, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, message=FALSE}

# the live collars in a single step rather than with three repeated 
# ones?

## Triangulation
R can perform triangulation through the package `sigloc` [@Berg2015]. This 
package uses the function `locate()` to estimate the position of a transmitter, 
in this case a VHF collar, based on three or more azimuths collected in the 
field. The algorithm used by `locate()` is based on a Maximum Likelihood 
Estimator (MLE; see package documentation and @Berg2015). In cases in which the 
MLE fails to estimate the location of the transmitter, this is estimated by 
taking the midpoint of the intersections of the lines drawn through the azimuths. 

The package `sigloc` requires all of the following elements associated with 
each azimuth:

* a date and time of collection, the latter in `HHMMSS` format
* a set of coordinates locating the listening points used to collect the azimuths
* a unique group identifier (GID) for sets of azimuths that go together, i.e. 
a collar's daily set of 3 or more azimuths

The following code assigns a unique GID to each unique combination of `Frequency` 
and `Date`. We save the new dataset in an object named `vhfData`.
```{r GID-assignment, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# remove unused levels from factor elements within liveData
liveData <- droplevels(liveData)

# isolate the IDs of each data entry, i.e. its unique Frequency
IDs <- paste(liveData[, "Frequency"]) 

# extract unique ID values, this vector will be used multiple time to index 
# loops
UniqIDs <- unique(IDs)

# create column names for new df
OutputFields <- c(paste(colnames(liveData)), "GID") 

# add GID column to original data
liveData$GID <- NA    
liveData$GID <- as.factor(liveData$GID)

# create new df
vhfData <- liveData[FALSE,] 

# remove useless GID column from original dataset
liveData$GID <- NULL 

# The following loop scans the data for groups of azimuths 
# obtained for each collar on each day of triangulation, and assigns a GID 
# based on the date of collection.

for (i in 1:length(UniqIDs)){
  # first, create a temporary dataset to host each Frequency's data in turn
  TmpInds <- which(IDs == UniqIDs[i]) 
  TmpData <- liveData[TmpInds,]   
  # assign a starting GID
  TmpData[1, "GID"] <- 1 
  for (j in 1:(nrow(TmpData) - 1)){
    if (TmpData$Year[j] == "2017" | TmpData$Grid[j] == "UNI"){
      # if the Date stays the same, we want to assign the same GID 
      if (TmpData[j + 1, "Date"] == TmpData[j, "Date"] &&
          TmpData[j + 1, "AM_PM"] == TmpData[j, "AM_PM"]){
        TmpData[j + 1, "GID"] <- TmpData[j, "GID"]
      }
      else {
        # if the Date changes, we want the GID to increase accordingly
        TmpData[j + 1, "GID"] <- TmpData[j, "GID"] + 1
      }
    }
    else {
      if (TmpData[j + 1, "Date"] == TmpData[j, "Date"]){
        TmpData[j + 1, "GID"] <- TmpData[j, "GID"]
      }
      else {
        # if the Date changes, we want the GID to increase accordingly
        TmpData[j + 1, "GID"] <- TmpData[j, "GID"] + 1
      }
    }
  }
  # browser()
  # bind each temp dataset into a new one
  vhfData <- rbind(vhfData, TmpData) 
}

vhfData$GID <- as.factor(vhfData$GID)
vhfData$Time <- as.numeric(vhfData$Time)

kable(vhfData, "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
                fixed_thead = TRUE) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "500px")

# kable(head(vhfData), "latex", booktabs = TRUE) %>% 
#   kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down", position = "center")
```

Now that the data is ready, the code chunk below performs the triangulation. We 
use a nested `for` loop with two levels. In the "outer" loop, we use the collar
frequencies to identify and separate one collar (individual) at the time from the 
`vhfData` data set. Then we use the GID that we assigned earlier to perform the 
actual triangulation one sampling day at the time for each individual 
sequentially. We then store relocations estimated in this way in a temporary 
object, which we then bind to the final dataset to use in subsequent 
analyses, `hares.triangd`. The author of the `sigloc` package, Dr. S. Berg, 
provided the loop, which circumvents a problem arising from having 
multiple individuals in a data set --- which necessarily means the whole data set 
has repeated GIDs. The code below generates two plots for each individual:

* the first plot is a collection of smaller graphs visualizing the triangulation
of each point: here, a black dot indicates that the maximum likelihood 
estimation was successful, whereas a red dot shows that the midpoint of the
intersections was used
* the second plot shows all the relocations in space, with the date printed over
each point and the individual's collar frequency printed at the top of the page

Note that we changed azimuths = 90$^\circ$ to 91$^\circ$ degrees to avoid 
having a mathematical angle of 0, which would cause the Maximum Likelihood 
Estimator used by `locate()` to return an error. This code chunk prints a 
message to show progress in the triangulation process: this is turned off by 
default, but it can be turned on by uncommenting the relevant lines in the code 
chunk (ll. 535--540).

Despite the observers' best efforts, there were cases in which the triangulation 
of an individual did not produce an accurate estimate of its location. These 
relocations may cause problems during the estimation of home range size, as they 
may stretch the home range size much as outlying points stretch a frequency 
distribution. The code chunk below highlights the individuals and the dates for 
which this happened and removes them from the data set.

### Visualizing the Triangulations
Below, we take a look at the "clean" relocation data set for each snowshoe hare.
In the following maps, the color of the dots corresponds to the day in which
the triangulation for that dot was carried out.

First, we calculate a 90% Minimum Convex Polygon around the complete dataset of
triangulated relocations from all individuals over the three years of this 
study. This will only be used to clip the FRI shapefile showing the various
forest polygons to the area of interest for this study, so as to speed up 
spatial mapping in R. 
```{r mapping-MCP, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# finally, remove the two collars that are not in Bloomfield
hares.triangd <- subset(hares.triangd, hares.triangd$Frequency != "149.374" & 
                          hares.triangd$Frequency != "149.474")

# add a grid identifier to the hares.triangd dataframe to calculate an overall
# home range
hares.triangd$Grid <- "Bloomfield"

# calculate an overall home range using 100% MCP to define study area for 
# mapping purposes ONLY
bl.mcp.all <- mcp(hares.triangd[, 10], percent = 90)

# transform the 100% MCP into a simple features object
bl.mcp.all <- st_as_sf(bl.mcp.all)
```

Then, we apply a 600 m buffer around this 90% MCP, to represent the uncertainty 
around this estimate --- even if it is taking all relocations into account. In 
the image below, the blue polygon is the 90% MCP and the red one is the 500 m 
buffer around it.
```{r mapping-MCP-buffer,echo=TRUE,tidy=TRUE}
bl.mcp.all500 <- st_buffer(bl.mcp.all, dist = 600) 

tm_shape(bl.mcp.all500) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0, border.col = "red") + 
  tm_shape(bl.mcp.all) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0, border.col = "blue") + 
  tm_compass() + tm_scale_bar()
```

Now, we use the function `st_intersect()` in the `sf` package to perform the 
actual clipping of the FRI shapefile to the buffer we just drew.
```{r bg-layer-loading, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, fig.cap="Map of the study area and the forest stands within 600 meters of the 90% MCP estimate border calculated from the whole triangulation dataset. Red dots represent trap locations on the live-trapping grid. "}

# and set it to the same crs as the triangulation data
forest_reproj <- st_transform(forest_gdb, crs = st_crs(hares.triangd))

# load grid trap locations shapefile
bl_grid_pts <- st_transform(bl_grid_points, crs = st_crs(hares.triangd))

# now, let's intersect the forest
forest_clip <- st_intersection(bl.mcp.all500, forest_reproj)
rm(forest_gdb) # remove the large FRI shapefile to make spatial R go faster

  tm_dots(size = 0.3, shape = 18, col = "red") + tm_compass() + tm_scale_bar()
```

Finally, we split the `Date` variable in the `hares.triangd` dataset into its 
three components: `Year`, `Month`, `Day`. This will be helpful for plotting
later on. Note that we do not remove the `Date` variable from the new dataset,
as it will also be helpful at later stages.

```{r triang-date-conversion, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# First, we are going to convert hares.triangd into a normal dataframe 
# and then split the field "Date" into its component elements "Year", "Month", 
# and "Day"
hares.triangd.longdate <- as.data.frame(hares.triangd) %>% 
  separate(., "Date", into = c("Year", "Month", "Day"), remove = FALSE) 

# Now, to turn the hares.traingd.LG dataframe back into a SpatialPointsDataFrame
# First, separate the columns containing the X and Y (Lat and Long) coordinates
# from the rest of the dataframe
hares.triangd.LG.coords <- hares.triangd.longdate[, c(14,15)]

# Use SpatialPointsDataFrame() to turn hares.triangd.LG into a spatial object
hares.triangd.LG <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords = hares.triangd.LG.coords, 
                                           data = hares.triangd.longdate, 
                                           proj4string = crs(hares.triangd))
```

Once we have this map of the area around out sampling grid, which shows the grid 
itself in red, we can plot the points triangulated earlier for each hare and 
see where they are located in space. As well, we can colour the points based on
date of collection and identify hares by eartag and year of sampling, which allows
for identification of those individuals with more than one sampling season.

## Home Range Estimation
After preliminary analyses, we decided to use a kernel Utilization Distribution 
(kUD) approach to estimating home range size, following the recommendations of 
@Borger2006. 

kUD works by estimating a smoothing parameter, *h* [@Calenge2006]. There are two 
main methods available within the package `adehabitatHR` to estimate *h*: an 
*ad hoc* method, commonly referred to as *reference bandwidth*, and a method 
based on Least Square Cross-Validation (LSCV). After initially using the LSCV 
method, we eventually switched to the *ad hoc* ('href') one. This is because 
with LSCV there were issues of the algorithm estimating *h* not converging 
within the range of values imposed on h. 

As noted here: 

* https://animov.faunalia.narkive.com/NnG9nLKl/again-kernelud-and-lscv
* https://jamesepaterson.github.io/jamespatersonblog/04_trackingworkshop_kernels

this is an ongoing issue with LSCV-powered kUD estimation, one which 
statisticians are still trying to solve. Using the *ad hoc* or *reference* 
method is thus more conservative in this case, and likely more conducive to 
comparisons between our present work and other studies.

To estimate the kernel utilization distribution, we need to specify a `grid` 
argument in the `kernelUD()` function. We will use the grid of one of our 
StDM-predicted rasters for this (e.g., vaanCN). To keep things consistent, 
we are going to use the extent of the `forest_clip` object we created above to 
clip the StDM raster to our study area. Note that the grid is the same for 
all StDM-predicted rasters, so this step is raster-agnostic. 

We will then estimate the kUD for each hare and then extract home range area. 
We will focus on the kUD's "core area", here defined as the 
areas in the home range where the probability of relocating an individuals is 1 
in 2 (i.e., 50%; @Borger2006), as well as the area within the 75% and 90% 
isopleths.
```{r homerange-estimation, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# before estimating the kUD, remove collars 149.513, 149.555, 150.032, 
# 150.052, 150.154 due to too few relocations available for estimating a 
# reliable kernel Utilization Distribution
hares.triangd <- subset(hares.triangd, hares.triangd$Frequency != "149.555" 
                        # & hares.triangd$Frequency != "150.032" & 
                        # hares.triangd$Frequency != "149.513" & 
                        # hares.triangd$Frequency != "150.052" & 
                        # hares.triangd$Frequency != "150.154"
)
 
# reproject the forest_clip object to the projection fo the StDM raster
# forest_clipTmerc<- st_transform(forest_clip, crs(vaanCN))

# convert clipped raster to SpatialPixelsDataFrame so it can be used in kUD 
# analysis 
vaancnASC <- asc.from.raster(vaancnclip)
vaanCNspdf <- asc2spixdf(vaancnASC)

# check the class of the new object
class(vaanCNspdf)

# reproject the triangulation data to the same projection of the StDM raster, 
# so we can actually map the points on top of the raster and kernelUD() can 
# work properly
hares.triangd<- spTransform(hares.triangd, crs(vaanCN))

hares.kUD <- kernelUD(hares.triangd[,8], h = 'href', grid = vaanCNspdf, 
                      extent = 1, same4all = FALSE)

# If reverting back to using LSCV to estimate h, double-check that minimization
# of the cross-validation criteria is successful using:
# plotLSCV(hares.kUD)

# Estimate kUD area using a range of percent levels
kUD.hr.estimates <- kernel.area(hares.kUD, percent = seq(50, 95, 5), 
                                unout = "ha")

# and extract values only for the core area to be used in later modelling
hrArea.50 <- kUD.hr.estimates[1, ]
hrArea.50 <- tidyr::pivot_longer(hrArea.50, cols = 1:ncol(hrArea.50), 
                                 names_to = "CollarFrequency", 
                                 values_to = "HRsize", names_prefix = "X")

# now, let's extract the home range contour
hares.kUDhr.50 <- getverticeshr(hares.kUD, percent = 50)

hares.kUDhr.75 <- getverticeshr(hares.kUD, percent = 75)

hares.kUDhr.90 <- getverticeshr(hares.kUD, percent = 90)
```

To check if the grid was large enough to estimate the kUD of each hare, we plot 
the home range contours just estimated on the raster itself. If the contours 
of the home range are completely inside the raster clip, then our estimation 
worked and we can move on.

```{r 50kUD-extent, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, fig.cap="Home range size estimates, produced using the 50% kUD isopleth, and StDM predictions for Blueberry C:N. As all home ranges are contained within the clipped raster, using the raster's extent as grid parameter to estimate home range size in kernelUD() is a viable approach."}

vaancnclip_frst <- crop(vaancnclip, extent_forest_clip)

### kUD Rarefaction Analysis

This code chunk builds accumulation curves for the kernel Utilization 
Distribution estimates from our sample of 30 snowshoe hares. The code we use 
in this script was developed by Dr. Bernardo Brandão Niebuhr [@movecology].

```{r kud-rarefaction-simple, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

cumHRkde <- list() ## List with cumulative sample size for all individuals

for (i in 1:length(ids)) {  ## loop for individuals
  temp <- hares.triangd[which(hares.triangd$Frequency == ids[i]),] # select an individual
  # Here we do not use the points as they are, but randomize their order using 'sample'
  temp <- SpatialPoints(coordinates(temp)[sample(length(temp)),], CRS(proj4string(hares.triangd)))
  cumulative <- vector()
  for(k in 5:length(temp)){  ##loop for sample size from 5 locations to all locations
    UD <- kernelUD(temp[1:k,], h = 'href', grid = vaanCNspdf, 
                   extent = 1, same4all = FALSE)
    cumulative[k] <- kernel.area(UD, percent = KDE_percentage)
  }  
  cumulative <- cumulative[5:length(cumulative)]

Now, let's randomize the order in which the locations are added to the plot 
before estimating the kUD.

### Overlap in kUD

The code below allows us to assess the overlap in the kUD of the four
individuals with 2 years each of telemetry sampling. We follow the advice
provided by [@Fieberg2006], and calculate several measures of overlap to then
compare them. In particular, we use percent overlap (`HR`), the probability of
overlap (`PHR`), the utilization distribution overlap index (`UDOI`), and the
Bhattacharyya's affinity index (`BA`). Here we briefly describe each of these
indexes, referring the interested reader to @Fieberg2006 for an in-depth 
discussion of their strengths and pitfalls. 

`HR` captures the proportion of home range estimate of one animal that is 
overlapped by that of another animal --- in our case, by the same animal the 
following year. `PHR` calculates the probability of an animal to be found in the 
home range of another animal. `UDOI` calculated the overlap between the two 
utilization distribution of the animal estimated from the two consecutive years.
Finally, `BA` capture the affinity between the two samples of points collected
in consecutive years from the same individual. 

In the SI, we include a shorter version of resulting table, reporting only the 
overlap measured through PHR and UDOI (Table S4).
```{r kUD-overlap, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
hares.triangd.LG <- spTransform(hares.triangd.LG, crs(vaanCN))

## Stoichiometric data extraction within home ranges
Now that we have estimates of the kUD and home range size for our snowshoe 
hares, we can use these spatial objects to extract the values of C:N:P 
stoichiometric ratios from Stoichiometric Distribution Models (StDMs; *sensu*
@Leroux2017) from within the core areas of the home ranges of our snowshoe 
hares. 

Note that this step involves only the use of the 50% kUD area estimates we 
calculated in the code chunk above and of the StDM-generated rasters predicting 
values of the C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios over the whole ecoregion. No clipping 
took place beforehand using the 90% Minimum Convex Polygon produced earlier 
(i.e., object `bl.mcp.all`), as that is only used in mapping instances to reduce
the time needed to produce maps through R.

```{r stoichHR, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# allocate an empty list of projected kUD as Spatial objects
stoich.hares <- data.frame(CollarFrequency = character(0),
                      # ABBA_CN = numeric(0), ABBA_CP = numeric(0), 
                      ACRU_CN = numeric(0), ACRU_NP = numeric(0), 
                      VAAN_CN = numeric(0), VAAN_CP = numeric(0), 
                      VAAN_NP = numeric(0))
