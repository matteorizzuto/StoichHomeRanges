	Abstract = {Despite the advent of GPS collars and technology, a large portion of wildlife studies still relies on radio-tracking to study the movement patterns, habitat selection, and space use of individual animals. I present here the ?sigloc? package for the R software, which offers basic functions to analyze radio-tracking data, methods to estimate the location of a VHF transmitter using azimuth bearings, and interfaces with other R packages and functions. These tools can be downloaded freely on the internet and provide a powerful environment for the analysis of radio telemetry data.},

	Title = {{Effects of sampling regime on the mean and variance of home range size estimates}},
	Volume = {75},
	Year = {2006},
	Abstract = {1. Although the home range is a fundamental ecological concept, there is considerable debate over how it is best measured. There is a substantial literature concerning the precision and accuracy of all commonly used home range estimation methods; however, there has been considerably less work concerning how estimates vary with sampling regime, and how this affects statistical inferences. 2. We propose a new procedure, based on a variance components analysis using generalized mixed effects models to examine how estimates vary with sampling regime. 3. To demonstrate the method we analyse data from one study of 32 individually marked roe deer and another study of 21 individually marked kestrels. We subsampled these data to simulate increasingly less intense sampling regimes, and compared the performance of two kernel density estimation (KDE) methods, of the minimum convex polygon (MCP) and of the bivariate ellipse methods. 4. Variation between individuals and study areas contributed most to the total variance in home range size. Contrary to recent concerns over reliability, both KDE methods were remarkably efficient, robust and unbiased: 10 fixes per month, if collected over a standardized number of days, were sufficient for accurate estimates of home range size. However, the commonly used 95{\%} isopleth should be avoided; we recommend using isopleths between 90 and 50{\%}. 5. Using the same number of fixes does not guarantee unbiased home range estimates: statistical inferences differ with the number of days sampled, even if using KDE methods. 6. The MCP method was highly inefficient and results were subject to considerable and unpredictable biases. The bivariate ellipse was not the most reliable method at low sample sizes. 7. We conclude that effort should be directed at marking more individuals monitored over long periods at the expense of the sampling rate per individual. Statistical results are reliable only if the whole sampling regime is standardized. We derive practical guidelines for field studies and data analysis.},

	Abstract = {Elucidating the mechanisms that influence spatial distribution patterns is vital to understanding how populations persist. We examined distribution in one of the most common salamanders in southeastern Michigan, the Blue-spotted Salamander (Ambystoma laterale-jeffersonianum unisexual complex). Three major tree species dominate the sub-canopy in the study site and form monospecific patches, which may have an effect on the distribution of terrestrial phases of local amphibian species. To examine this, we tested whether adult salamanders are significantly associated negatively or positively with patches of particular tree species. We then examined two potential causal factors: habitat quality, using leaf litter macroinvertebrate biomass as a proxy, and behavioral site choice in the Blue-spotted Salamander. We found that this species is positively associated with patches of red maple and negatively associated with patches of black cherry. We also found that, when presented with a choice, salamanders choose red maple leaf litter over black cherry leaf litter. In the absence of differences in physical leaf litter characteristics between patches of red maple and black cherry, we suggest that the Blue-spotted Salamander may be utilizing chemical cues to select habitat. Our findings imply that salamander populations may be affected not only by habitat loss, but also by changes in forest composition. These results provide evidence for a more complex model than the traditional amphibian metapopulation concept, where even fully forested habitat may form a matrix of optimal and sub-optimal, or even intolerable, patches.},

	Year = {2017},
	Abstract = {Kernel density estimators are widely applied to area-related problems in ecology, from estimating the home range of an individual to estimating the geographic range of a species. Currently, area estimates are obtained indirectly, by first estimating the location distribution from tracking (home range) or survey (geographic range) data and then estimating areas from that distribution. This indirect approach leads to biased area estimates and difficulty in deriving reasonable confidence intervals. We introduce a new kernel density estimator (and associated confidence intervals) focused specifically on area estimation that applies to both independently sampled survey data and autocorrelated tracking data. We test our methods against simulated movement data and demonstrate its use with African buffalo data. The area-corrected kernel density estimator produces much more accurate area estimates, particularly at small sample sizes, and the newly derived confidence intervals are more reliable than existing alternatives. This new method is the most efficient nonparametric home-range estimator for animal tracking data and should also be considered when calculating nonparametric range estimates from survey data. This estimator is now the default method in the ctmm r package.},

	Volume = {10},
	Year = {2019},
	Abstract = {Technological advances have steadily increased the detail of animal tracking datasets, yet fundamental data limitations exist for many species that cause substantial biases in home-range estimation. Specifically, the effective sample size of a range estimate is proportional to the number of observed range crossings, not the number of sampled locations. Currently, the most accurate home-range estimators condition on an autocorrelation model, for which the standard estimation frame-works are based on likelihood functions, even though these methods are known to underestimate variance---and therefore ranging area---when effective sample sizes are small. Residual maximum likelihood (REML) is a widely used method for reducing bias in maximum-likelihood (ML) variance estimation at small sample sizes. Unfortunately, we find that REML is too unstable for practical application to continuous-time movement models. When the effective sample size N is decreased to N ≤ (Formula presented.) (10), which is common in tracking applications, REML undergoes a sudden divergence in variance estimation. To avoid this issue, while retaining REML's first-order bias correction, we derive a family of estimators that leverage REML to make a perturbative correction to ML. We also derive AIC values for REML and our estimators, including cases where model structures differ, which is not generally understood to be possible. Using both simulated data and GPS data from lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), we show how our perturbative estimators are more accurate than traditional ML and REML methods. Specifically, when (Formula presented.) (5) home-range crossings are observed, REML is unreliable by orders of magnitude, ML home ranges are {\~{}}30{\%} underestimated, and our perturbative estimators yield home ranges that are only {\~{}}10{\%} underestimated. A parametric bootstrap can then reduce the ML and perturbative home-range underestimation to {\~{}}10{\%} and {\~{}}3{\%}, respectively. Home-range estimation is one of the primary reasons for collecting animal tracking data, and small effective sample sizes are a more common problem than is currently realized. The methods introduced here allow for more accurate movement-model and home-range estimation at small effective sample sizes, and thus fill an important role for animal movement analysis. Given REML's widespread use, our methods may also be useful in other contexts where effective sample sizes are small.},

	Abstract = {Background: Characterizing animal space use is critical for understanding ecological relationships. Animal telemetry technology has revolutionized the fields of ecology and conservation biology by providing high quality spatial data on animal movement. Radio-telemetry with very high frequency (VHF) radio signals continues to be a useful technology because of its low cost, miniaturization, and low battery requirements. Despite a number of statistical developments synthetically integrating animal location estimation and uncertainty with spatial process models using satellite telemetry data, we are unaware of similar developments for azimuthal telemetry data. As such, there are few statistical options to handle these unique data and no synthetic framework for modeling animal location uncertainty and accounting for it in ecological models. We developed a hierarchical modeling framework to provide robust animal location estimates from one or more intersecting or non-intersecting azimuths. We used our azimuthal telemetry model (ATM) to account for azimuthal uncertainty with covariates and propagate location uncertainty into spatial ecological models. We evaluate the ATM with commonly used estimators (Lenth (1981) maximum likelihood and M-Estimators) using simulation. We also provide illustrative empirical examples, demonstrating the impact of ignoring location uncertainty within home range and resource selection analyses. We further use simulation to better understand the relationship among location uncertainty, spatial covariate autocorrelation, and resource selection inference. Results: We found the ATM to have good performance in estimating locations and the only model that has appropriate measures of coverage. Ignoring animal location uncertainty when estimating resource selection or home ranges can have pernicious effects on ecological inference. Home range estimates can be overly confident and conservative when ignoring location uncertainty and resource selection coefficients can lead to incorrect inference and over confidence in the magnitude of selection. Furthermore, our simulation study clarified that incorporating location uncertainty helps reduce bias in resource selection coefficients across all levels of covariate spatial autocorrelation. Conclusion: The ATM can accommodate one or more azimuths when estimating animal locations, regardless of how they intersect; this ensures that all data collected are used for ecological inference. Our findings and model development have important implications for interpreting historical analyses using this type of data and the future design of radio-telemetry studies.},

	Abstract = {Human activities are altering the fundamental geography of biogeochemicals. Yet we lack an understanding of how the spatial patterns in organismal stoichiometry affect biogeochemical processes and the tools to predict the impacts of global changes on biogeochemical processes. In this contribution we develop stoichiometric distribution models (StDMs), which allow us to map spatial structure in resource elemental composition across a landscape and evaluate spatial responses of consumers. We parameterise StDMs for a consumer-resource (moose-white birch) system and demonstrate that we can develop predictive models of resource stoichiometry across a landscape and that such models could improve our predictions of consumer space use. With results from our study system application, we argue that explicit consideration of the spatial patterns in organismal elemental composition may uncover emergent individual, population, community and ecosystem properties that are not revealed at the local extents routinely used in ecological stoichiometry. We discuss perspectives for further developments and application of StDMs to advance three emerging frameworks for spatial ecosystem ecology in an era of global change; meta-ecosystem theory, macroecological stoichiometry and remotely sensed biogeochemistry. Progress on these emerging frameworks will allow for the integration of ecological stoichiometry and individual space use and fitness.},

	Abstract = {Research in applied ecology provides scientific evidence to guide conservation policy and management. Applied ecology is becoming increasingly quantitative and model selection via information criteria has become a common statistical modeling approach. Unfortunately, parameters that contain little to no useful information are commonly presented and interpreted as important in applied ecology. I review the concept of an uninformative parameter in model selection using information criteria and perform a literature review to measure the prevalence of uninformative parameters in model selection studies applying Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) in 2014 in four of the top journals in applied ecology (Biological Conservation, Conservation Biology, Ecological Applications, Journal of Applied Ecology). Twenty-one percent of studies I reviewed applied AIC metrics. Many (31.5{\%}) of the studies applying AIC metrics in the four applied ecology journals I reviewed had or were very likely to have uninformative parameters in a model set. In addition, more than 40{\%} of studies reviewed had insufficient information to assess the presence or absence of uninformative parameters in a model set. Given the prevalence of studies likely to have uninformative parameters or with insufficient information to assess parameter status (71.5{\%}), I surmise that much of the policy recommendations based on applied ecology research may not be supported by the data analysis. I provide four warning signals and a decision tree to assist authors, reviewers, and editors to screen for uninformative parameters in studies applying model selection with information criteria. In the end, careful thinking at every step of the scientific process and greater reporting standards are required to detect uninformative parameters in studies adopting an information criteria approach.},

	Volume = {9},
	Year = {2019},
	Abstract = {Intraspecific variability in ecological traits is widespread in nature. Recent evidence, mostly from aquatic ecosystems, shows individuals differing at the most fundamental level, that of their chemical composition. Age, sex, or body size and condition may be key drivers of intraspecific variability in the body concentrations of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). However, we still have a rudimentary understanding of the patterns and drivers of intraspecific variability in chemical composition of terrestrial consumers, particularly vertebrates. Here, we investigate the elemental composition of the snowshoe hare Lepus americanus. Based on snowshoe hare ecology, we predicted older, larger individuals to have higher concentration of N or P and lower C content compared with younger, smaller individuals. We also predicted females to have higher concentrations of N, P, and lower C than males due to the higher reproductive costs they incur. Finally, we predicted that individuals in better body condition would have higher N and P than those in worse condition, irrespective of age. We obtained C, N, and P concentrations and ratios from a sample of 50 snowshoe hares. We then used general linear models to test our predictions on the relationship between age, sex, body size or condition and stoichiometric variability in hares. We found considerable variation in C, N, and P stoichiometry within our sample. Contrary to our predictions, we found weak evidence of N content decreasing with age. As well, sex appeared to have no relationship with hare body elemental composition. Conversely, as expected, P content increased with body size and condition. Finally, we found no relationship between variability in C content and any of our predictor variables. Snowshoe hare stoichiometry does not appear to vary with individual age, sex, body size, or condition. However, the weak relationship between body N concentration and age may suggest varying nutritional requirements of individuals at different ages. Conversely, body P's weak relationship to body size and condition appears in line with this limiting element's importance in terrestrial ecosystems. Snowshoe hares are keystone herbivores in the boreal forest of North America, and the substantial stoichiometric variability we find in our sample could have important implications for nutrient dynamics, in both boreal and adjacent ecosystems.},
