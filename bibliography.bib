abstract = {Forest fragmentation may benefit generalist herbivores by increasing access to various substitutable food resources, with potential consequences for their population dynamics. We studied a European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) population living in an agricultural mosaic of forest, woodlots, meadows and cultivated crops. We tested whether diet composition and quality varied spatially across the landscape using botanical analyses of rumen contents and chemical analyses of the plants consumed in relation to landscape metrics. In summer and non-mast winters, roe deer ate more cultivated seeds and less native forest browse with increasing availability of crops in the local landscape. This spatial variation resulted in contrasting diet quality, with more cell content and lower lignin and hemicellulose content (high quality) for individuals living in more open habitats. The pattern was less marked in the other seasons when diet composition, but not diet quality, was only weakly related to landscape structure. In mast autumns and winters, the consumption of acorns across the entire landscape resulted in a low level of differentiation in diet composition and quality. Our results reflect the ability of generalist species, such as roe deer, to adapt to the fragmentation of their forest habitat by exhibiting a plastic feeding behavior, enabling them to use supplementary resources available in the agricultural matrix. This flexibility confers nutritional advantages to individuals with access to cultivated fields when their native food resources are depleted or decline in quality (e. g. during non-mast years) and may explain local heterogeneities in individual phenotypic quality. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Identifying factors shaping variation in resource selection is central for our understanding of the behaviour and distribution of animals. We examined summer habitat selection and space use by 108 Global Positioning System (GPS)-collared moose in Norway in relation to sex, reproductive status, habitat quality, and availability. Moose selected habitat types based on a combination of forage quality and availability of suitable habitat types. Selection of protective cover was strongest for reproducing females, likely reflecting the need to protect young. Males showed strong selection for habitat types with high quality forage, possibly due to higher energy requirements. Selection for preferred habitat types providing food and cover was a positive function of their availability within home ranges (i.e. not proportional use) indicating functional response in habitat selection. This relationship was not found for unproductive habitat types. Moreover, home ranges with high cover of unproductive habitat types were larger, and smaller home ranges contained higher proportions of the most preferred habitat type. The distribution of moose within the study area was partly related to the distribution of different habitat types. Our study shows how distribution and availability of habitat types providing cover and high-quality food shape ungulate habitat selection and space use. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

	Volume = {46},
	Year = {2020},
	Abstract = {Non-nutritive phytochemicals (secondary metabolites and fibre) can influence plant resistance to herbivores and have ecological impacts on animal and plant population dynamics. A major hindrance to the ecological study of these phytochemicals is the uncertainty in the compounds one should measure, especially when limited by cost and expertise. With the underlying goal of identifying proxies of plant resistance to herbivores, we performed a systematic review of the effects of non-nutritive phytochemicals on consumption by leporids (rabbits and hares) and cervids (deer family). We identified 133 out of 1790 articles that fit our selection criteria (leporids = 33, cervids = 97, both herbivore types = 3). These articles cover 18 species of herbivores, on four continents. The most prevalent group of phytochemicals in the selected articles was phenolics, followed by terpenes for leporids and by fibre for cervids. In general, the results were variable but phenolic concentration seems linked with high resistance to both types of herbivores. Terpene concentration is also linked to high plant resistance; this relationship seems driven by total terpene content for cervids and specific terpenes for leporids. Tannins and fibre did not have a consistent positive effect on plant resistance. Because of the high variability in results reported and the synergistic effects of phytochemicals, we propose that the choice of chemical analyses must be tightly tailored to research objectives. While researchers pursuing ecological or evolutionary objectives should consider multiple specific analyses, researchers in applied studies could focus on a fewer Issue of specific analyses. An improved consideration of plant defence, based on meaningful chemical analyses, could improve studies of plant resistance and allow us to predict novel or changing plant-herbivore interactions.},

	Volume = {9},
	Year = {2018},
	Abstract = {The research literature on food selection by large herbivores is extensive. Still, we are generally lacking in our knowledge of the influence of potentially interacting chemical contents of the food. We made a qualitative review of a systematic literature search of studies that empirically link chemical contents of food to the food selection by northern cervids (genera Alces, Capreolus, Cervus, Dama, Odocoileus, Rangifer). We found that although the majority of the 98 relevant studies measuring any given food constituent (energy, protein, fiber, minerals, plant secondary metabolites) provided support for it acting as a driver of food selection (in either a negative or positive way), there was little support for the traditional hypotheses of maximization or limitation of any single constituent. Rather, because of the animals' need to acquire an appropriate intake of several constituents at the same time, our review highlights how new empirical studies need to focus on several food constituents in synchrony: (1) Study designs should capture sufficient variation in the content of food constituents in order to tease apart their many co-variations; and (2) insights about nutritional drivers may be lost if one uses only composite currencies such as crude energy, crude fiber, ash, or tannins, which may mask contrasting selection patterns of the lumped constituents. Season had an apparent influence on the selection of some food constituents, particularly various fiber fractions. In contrast, our review revealed a lack of evidence that cervids more strongly select for protein in summer than they do in winter. Our overall conclusion of the review is that interacting chemical contents of food make the nutritional value of a given food type into a varying entity. To better elucidate this variation, we need new technologies that non-invasively capture nutrient intake of free-ranging animals, across seasons.},

	Year = {2016},
	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Nordic Society Oikos.Within the last two decades, ecological stoichiometry (ES) and nutritional geometry (NG, also known as geometric framework for nutrition) have delivered novel insights into core questions of nutritional ecology. These two nutritionally explicit frameworks differ in the 'nutrient currency' used and the focus of their past research; behavioural feeding strategies in NG, mainly investigating terrestrial organisms, and trophic ecology in ES, mainly in aquatic settings. However, both NG and ES have developed in explaining patterns across various scales of biological organization. Integrating specific tools of these frameworks could advance the field of nutritional ecology by unifying theoretical and empirical approaches from the organismal to ecosystem level processes. Toward this integration, we identified 1) nutrient/element budgets as a shared concept of both frameworks that encompass nutrient intake, retention, and release, 2) response surface plots of NG as powerful tools to illustrate processes at the organismal level and 3) the concept of consumer-driven nutrient recycling (CNR) of ES as a useful tool bridging organism and ecosystem scales. We applied response surface plots to element budget data from an ES study to show how this approach can deliver new insights at the organismal level, e.g. by showing the interplay between egestion and excretion depending simultaneously on the consumed amount of carbon and phosphorus based on variation across individuals. By integrating concepts of ES and NG to model microbial uptake and mineralization of nitrogenous wastes reported in a NG study, we also demonstrate that considering biochemically explicit mineralization rates of organic wastes can improve predictions of CNR by reducing over- or underestimation of mineralization depending on the quality of the consumer's diet. Our presented tools and approaches can help to bridge the organismal and ecosystem level, advancing the predictive power of studies in nutritional ecology at multiple ecological scales. Oikos},

	Volume = {123},
	Year = {2014},
	Abstract = {A central goal of nutritional ecology is to understand how variation in food quality limits the persistence of wild animal populations. Habitat suitability for browsing mammals is strongly affected by concentrations of nutrients and plant secondary metabolites (PSMs), but our understanding of this is based mostly on short-term experiments of diet selection involving captive animals. In the wild, browsers forage in biologically, chemically and spatially-complex environments, and foraging decisions in response to varying food quality will be correspondingly complicated. We have identified four steps that must be achieved in order to translate our understanding from laboratory experiments to populations of mammalian browsers: 1) knowing what foods and how much of these wild browsers eat, as well as what they avoid eating; 2) knowing the relevant aspects of plant nutritional and defensive chemistry to measure in a given system and how to measure them; 3) understanding the spatial distribution of nutrients and PSMs in plant communities, the costs they impose on foraging and the effects on animals' distributions; and 4) having appropriate statistical tools to analyse the data. We discuss prospects for each of these prerequisites for extending laboratory studies of nutritional quality, and review recent developments that may off er solutions for field studies. We also provide a synthesis of how to use this nutritional knowledge to link food quality to population regulation in wild mammals and describe examples that have successfully achieved this aim.},

	Abstract = {Many studies have tried to assess the role of both deterministic and stochastic processes in community assembly, yet a lack of consensus exists on which processes are more prevalent and at which spatial scales they operate. To shed light on this issue, we tested two nonmutually exclusive, scale-dependent hypotheses: (1) that competitive exclusion dominates at small spatial scales; and (2) that environmental filtering does so at larger ones. To accomplish this, we studied the functional patterns of tropical montane forest communities along two altitudinal gradients, in Ecuador and Peru, using floristic and functional data from 60 plots of 0.1 ha. We found no evidence of either functional overdispersion or clustering at small spatial scales, but we did find functional clustering at larger ones. The observed pattern of clustering, consistent with an environmental filtering process, was more evident when maximizing the environmental differences among any pair of plots. To strengthen the link between the observed community functional pattern and the underlying process of environmental filtering, we explored differences in the climatic preferences of the most abundant species found at lower and higher elevations and examined whether their abundances shifted along the elevation gradient. We found (1) that greater community functional differences (observed between lower and upper tropical montane forest assemblies) were mostly the result of strong climatic preferences, maintained across the Neotropics; and (2) that the abundances of such species shifted along the elevational gradient. Our findings support the conclusion that, at large spatial scales, environmental filtering is the overriding mechanism for community assembly, because the pattern of functional clustering was linked to species' similarities in their climatic preferences, which ultimately resulted in shifts in species abundances along the gradient. However, there was no evidence of competitive exclusion at more homogeneous, smaller spatial scales, where plant species effectively compete for resources.},

	Abstract = {Competition is a widespread interaction among carnivores, ultimately manifested through one or more dimensions of the species' ecological niche. One of the most explicit manifestations of competitive interactions regards spatial displacement. Its interpretation under a theoretical context provides an important tool to deepen our understanding of biological systems and communities, but also for wildlife management and conservation. We used Bayesian multispecies occupancy models on camera-trapping data from multiple sites in Southwestern Europe (SWE) to investigate competitive interactions within a carnivore guild, and to evaluate how species' ecological traits are shaping coexistence patterns. Seventeen out of 26 pairwise interactions departed from a hypothesis of independent occurrence, with spatial association being twice as frequent as avoidance. Association behaviors were only detected among mesocarnivores, while avoidance mainly involved mesocarnivores avoiding the apex predator (n = 4) and mesocarnivore-only interactions (n = 2). Body mass ratios, defined as the dominant over the subordinate species body mass, revealed an important negative effect ((Formula presented.)) on co-occurrence probability, and support that spatially explicit competitive interactions are mostly expressed by larger species able to dominate over smaller ones, with a threshold in body mass ratios of {\~{}}4, above which local-scale intraguild coexistence is unlikely. We found a weak relationship between pairwise trophic niche overlap and the probability of coexistence ((Formula presented.)), suggesting that competition for feeding resources may not be a key driver of competition, at least at the scale of our analysis. Despite local-scale avoidance, regional-scale coexistence appears to be maintained by the spatial structuring of the competitive environment. We provide evidence that SWE ecosystems consist of spatially structured competitive environments, and propose that coexistence among near-sized species is likely achieved through the interplay of ``facultative'' and ``behavioral'' character displacements. Factors influencing carnivore coexistence likely include context-dependent density and trait-mediated effects, which should be carefully considered for a sound understanding of the mechanisms regulating these communities.},

	Abstract = {Divergent movement strategies have enabled wildlife populations to adapt to environmental change. In recent decades, the Southern Beaufort Sea subpopulation of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) has developed a divergent movement strategy in response to diminishing sea ice where the majority of the subpopulation (73--85{\%}) stays on the sea ice in summer and the remaining bears move to land. Although declines in sea ice are generally considered a challenge to energy balance in polar bears residing in some regions of the Arctic, little quantitative data exists concerning the seasonal energy expenditures of this apex marine carnivore. We used GPS satellite collars with tri-axial accelerometers and conductivity sensors to measure the location, behavior, and energy expenditure of five adult female polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea across seasons of sea ice breakup and minimum extent. Using a Bayesian mixed-effects model, we found that energy expenditure was influenced by month, ocean depth, and habitat type (sea ice or land). Total energy expenditure from May through September ranged from 37.7 to 47.2 mJ/kg for individual bears. Bears that moved to land expended 7{\%} more energy on average from May through September than bears that remained on the receding sea ice. In August, when bears were moving from the sea ice to land or moving north with the receding pack ice, bears that moved to land spent 7{\%} more time swimming and expended 22{\%} more energy. This means the immediate cost of moving to land exceeded the cost of remaining on the receding summer pack ice. These findings suggest a physiological reason why the majority of the Southern Beaufort Sea subpopulation continues to inhabit a diminishing summer ice platform. However, bears that moved to land spent 29{\%} more time in preferred hunting habitats over the continental shelf than bears that remained on the sea ice. Bears on land also had access to subsistence-harvested bowhead whale carcasses. Hence, our findings indicate there may be a greater overall energetic benefit to move to land in this region, which suggests that the use of the diminishing summer sea ice may be functioning as an ecological trap.},

These studies commonly produce spatial predictions, which are of considerable utility to resource managers making habitat and population management decisions. It is thus paramount that predictions from resource selection studies are accurate. We evaluated model building and fitting strategies for optimizing resource selection function predictions in a use-availability framework. We did so by simulating low- and high-intensity spatial sampling data that respectively predicted study area and movement-based resource selection. We compared one of the most commonly used forms of statistical regularization, Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), with the lesser used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). LASSO predictions were less variable and more accurate than AIC and were often best when considering additive and interacting variables. We explicitly demonstrate the predictive equivalence using the logistic and Poisson likelihoods and how it is lost when the available sample is too small. Regardless of modeling approach, interpreting the sign of coefficients as a measure of selection can be misleading when optimizing for prediction.},

	Abstract = {Despite the routine nature of estimating overlapping space use in ecological research, to date no formal inferential framework for home range overlap has been available to ecologists. Part of this issue is due to the inherent difficulty of comparing the estimated home ranges that underpin overlap across individuals, studies, sites, species, and times. As overlap is calculated conditionally on a pair of home range estimates, biases in these estimates will propagate into biases in overlap estimates. Further compounding the issue of comparability in home range estimators is the historical lack of confidence intervals on overlap estimates. This means that it is not currently possible to determine if a set of overlap values is statistically different from one another. As a solution, we develop the first rigorous inferential framework for home range overlap. Our framework is based on the autocorrelated-Kernel density estimation (AKDE) family of home range estimators, which correct for biases due to autocorrelation, small effective sample size, and irregular sampling in time. Collectively, these advances allow AKDE estimates to validly be compared even when sampling strategies differ. We then couple the AKDE estimates with a novel bias-corrected Bhattacharyya coefficient (BC) to quantify overlap. Finally, we propagate uncertainty in the AKDE estimates through to overlap and thus are able to put confidence intervals on the BC point estimate. Using simulated data, we demonstrate how our inferential framework provides accurate overlap estimates, and reasonable coverage of the true overlap, even at small sample sizes. When applied to empirical data, we found that building an interaction network for Mongolian gazelles Procapra gutturosa based on all possible ties, vs. only those ties with statistical support, substantially influenced the network's properties and any potential biological inferences derived from it. Our inferential framework permits researchers to calculate overlap estimates that can validly be compared across studies, sites, species, and times, and test whether observed differences are statistically meaningful. This method is available via the R package ctmm.},

	Abstract = {Canadian boreal woodlands and forests cover approximately 3.09 × 10 6 km 2 , located within a larger boreal zone characterized by cool summers and long cold winters. Warming since the 1850s, increases in annual mean temperature of at least 2 $\,^{\circ}$C between 2000 and 2050 are highly probable. Annual mean temperatures across the Canadian boreal zone could be 4--5 $\,^{\circ}$C warmer than today's by 2100. All aspects of boreal forest ecosystem function are likely to be affected. Further, several potential ``tipping elements'' --- where exposure to increasing changes in climate may trigger distinct shifts in ecosystem state --- can be identified across the Canadian boreal zone. Approximately 40{\%} of the forested area is underlain by permafrost, some of which is already degrading irreversibly, triggering a process of forest decline and re-establishment lasting several decades, while also releasing significant quantities of greenhouse gases that will amplify the future global warming trend. Warmer temperatures coupled with significant changes in the distribution and timing of annual precipitation are likely to cause serious tree-killing droughts in the west; east of the Great Lakes, however, where precipitation is generally nonlimiting, warming coupled with increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide may stimulate higher forest productivity. Large wildfires, which can cause serious economic losses, are expected to become more frequent, but increases in mean annual area burned will be relatively gradual. The most immediate threats could come from endemic forest insect pests that have the potential for population outbreaks in response to relatively small temperature increases. Quantifying the multiple effects of climate change will be challenging, particularly because there are great uncertainties attached to possible interactions among them, as well as with other land-use pressures. Considerable ingenuity will be needed from forest managers and scientists to address the formidable challenges posed by climate change to boreal ecosystems and develop effective strategies to adapt sustainable forest management practices to the impending changes.},

	Abstract = {The island of Newfoundland is unique because it has as many non-native terrestrial mammals as native ones. The impacts of non-native species on native flora and fauna can be profound and invasive species have been identified as one of the primary drivers of species extinction. Few studies, however, have investigated the effects of a non-native species assemblage on community and ecosystem properties. We reviewed the literature to build the first terrestrial mammal food web for the island of Newfoundland and then used network analyses to investigate how the timing of introductions and trophic position of non-native species has affected the structure of the terrestrial mammal food web in Newfoundland. The first non-native mammals (house mouse and brown rat) became established in Newfoundland with human settlement in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Coyotes and southern red-backed voles are the most recent mammals to establish themselves on the island in 1985 and 1998, respectively. The fraction of intermediate species increased with the addition of non-native mammals over time whereas the fraction of basal and top species declined over time. This increase in intermediate species mediated by non-native species arrivals led to an overall increase in the terrestrial mammal food web connectance and generality (i.e. mean Issue of prey per predator). This diverse prey base and sources of carrion may have facilitated the natural establishment of coyotes on the island. Also, there is some evidence that the introduction of non-native prey species such as the southern red-backed vole has contributed to the recovery of the threatened American marten. Long-term monitoring of the food web is required to understand and predict the impacts of the diverse novel interactions that are developing in the terrestrial mammal food web of Newfoundland.},

We examined placental scars in yearling Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis (Kerr, 1792)) from the island of Newfoundland and used pregnancy rates and litter sizes to indicate primiparity. We modelled these lynx productivity data with snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus Erxleben, 1777) population attributes using seven multiple a priori competing hypotheses. Hare abundance showed peak, decline, and increase phases, and densities based on capture--mark--recapture estimates ranged from 0.11 to 1.19 hares{\textperiodcentered}ha −1 . Overall, yearling pregnancy rate was 23.5{\%} and the model with hare abundance fitted alone had the most support. However, surprisingly hare abundance explained little (6{\%}) variation in yearling pregnancy rate. Mean ($\pm$SE) litter size was 3.51 $\pm$ 0.27. None of our covariate models provided unequivocal support for predicting yearling litter size. We speculate that individuals may exhibit behavioural plasticity such that they can dampen the impact of primary prey abundance on yearling pregnancy rate by exploiting alternate prey. Furthermore, intraspecific social interactions may provide additional insight into the determinants of pregnancy rate in yearling lynx.},

	Volume = {10},
	Year = {2019},
	Abstract = {Technological advances have steadily increased the detail of animal tracking datasets, yet fundamental data limitations exist for many species that cause substantial biases in home-range estimation. Specifically, the effective sample size of a range estimate is proportional to the Issue of observed range crossings, not the Issue of sampled locations. Currently, the most accurate home-range estimators condition on an autocorrelation model, for which the standard estimation frame-works are based on likelihood functions, even though these methods are known to underestimate variance---and therefore ranging area---when effective sample sizes are small. Residual maximum likelihood (REML) is a widely used method for reducing bias in maximum-likelihood (ML) variance estimation at small sample sizes. Unfortunately, we find that REML is too unstable for practical application to continuous-time movement models. When the effective sample size N is decreased to N ≤ (Formula presented.) (10), which is common in tracking applications, REML undergoes a sudden divergence in variance estimation. To avoid this issue, while retaining REML's first-order bias correction, we derive a family of estimators that leverage REML to make a perturbative correction to ML. We also derive AIC values for REML and our estimators, including cases where model structures differ, which is not generally understood to be possible. Using both simulated data and GPS data from lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), we show how our perturbative estimators are more accurate than traditional ML and REML methods. Specifically, when (Formula presented.) (5) home-range crossings are observed, REML is unreliable by orders of magnitude, ML home ranges are {\~{}}30{\%} underestimated, and our perturbative estimators yield home ranges that are only {\~{}}10{\%} underestimated. A parametric bootstrap can then reduce the ML and perturbative home-range underestimation to {\~{}}10{\%} and {\~{}}3{\%}, respectively. Home-range estimation is one of the primary reasons for collecting animal tracking data, and small effective sample sizes are a more common problem than is currently realized. The methods introduced here allow for more accurate movement-model and home-range estimation at small effective sample sizes, and thus fill an important role for animal movement analysis. Given REML's widespread use, our methods may also be useful in other contexts where effective sample sizes are small.},

Currently, area estimates are obtained indirectly, by first estimating the location distribution from tracking (home range) or survey (geographic range) data and then estimating areas from that distribution. This indirect approach leads to biased area estimates and difficulty in deriving reasonable confidence intervals. We introduce a new kernel density estimator (and associated confidence intervals) focused specifically on area estimation that applies to both independently sampled survey data and autocorrelated tracking data. We test our methods against simulated movement data and demonstrate its use with African buffalo data. The area-corrected kernel density estimator produces much more accurate area estimates, particularly at small sample sizes, and the newly derived confidence intervals are more reliable than existing alternatives. This new method is the most efficient nonparametric home-range estimator for animal tracking data and should also be considered when calculating nonparametric range estimates from survey data. This estimator is now the default method in the ctmm r package.},

	Abstract = {Background: Characterizing animal space use is critical for understanding ecological relationships. Animal telemetry technology has revolutionized the fields of ecology and conservation biology by providing high quality spatial data on animal movement. Radio-telemetry with very high frequency (VHF) radio signals continues to be a useful technology because of its low cost, miniaturization, and low battery requirements. Despite a Issue of statistical developments synthetically integrating animal location estimation and uncertainty with spatial process models using satellite telemetry data, we are unaware of similar developments for azimuthal telemetry data. As such, there are few statistical options to handle these unique data and no synthetic framework for modeling animal location uncertainty and accounting for it in ecological models. We developed a hierarchical modeling framework to provide robust animal location estimates from one or more intersecting or non-intersecting azimuths. We used our azimuthal telemetry model (ATM) to account for azimuthal uncertainty with covariates and propagate location uncertainty into spatial ecological models. We evaluate the ATM with commonly used estimators (Lenth (1981) maximum likelihood and M-Estimators) using simulation. We also provide illustrative empirical examples, demonstrating the impact of ignoring location uncertainty within home range and resource selection analyses. We further use simulation to better understand the relationship among location uncertainty, spatial covariate autocorrelation, and resource selection inference. Results: We found the ATM to have good performance in estimating locations and the only model that has appropriate measures of coverage. Ignoring animal location uncertainty when estimating resource selection or home ranges can have pernicious effects on ecological inference. Home range estimates can be overly confident and conservative when ignoring location uncertainty and resource selection coefficients can lead to incorrect inference and over confidence in the magnitude of selection. Furthermore, our simulation study clarified that incorporating location uncertainty helps reduce bias in resource selection coefficients across all levels of covariate spatial autocorrelation. Conclusion: The ATM can accommodate one or more azimuths when estimating animal locations, regardless of how they intersect; this ensures that all data collected are used for ecological inference. Our findings and model development have important implications for interpreting historical analyses using this type of data and the future design of radio-telemetry studies.},

	abstract = {Intraspecific variation in plant traits has important consequences for individual fitness and herbivore foraging. For plants, trait variability across spatial dimensions is well documented. However, temporal dimensions of trait variability are less well known, and may be influenced by seasonal differences in growing degree days, temperature, and precipitation. Here, we aim to quantify intraspecific temporal variation in traits and the underlying drivers for four commonly occurring boreal plant species.We sampled the elemental and stoichiometric traits ($\backslash$$\backslash${\%}C, $\backslash$$\backslash${\%}N, $\backslash$$\backslash${\%}P, C:N, C:P, N:P) of four common browse species' foliage across two years. Using a two-step approach, we first fitted generalized linear models (GzLM, n = 24) to the species' elemental and stoichiometric traits, and tested if they varied across years. When we observed evidence for temporal variability, we fitted a second set of GzLMs (n = 8) with temperature, productivity, and moisture as explanatory variables.We found no evidence of temporal variation for most of the elemental and stoichiometric traits of our four boreal plants, with two exceptions. Year was an important predictor for percent carbon across all four species (R 2 = 0.47 to 0.67) and for multiple elemental and stoichiometric traits in balsam fir (5/8, R 2 = 0.29 to 0.67). Thus, variation in percent carbon was related to interannual differences, more so than nitrogen and phosphorus, which are limiting nutrients in the boreal forest. These results also indicate that year may explain more variation in conifers' stoichiometry than for deciduous plants due to life history differences. Growing degree days (GDD) was the most frequently occurring variable in the second round of models (8/8 times, R 2 = 0.21 to 0.41), suggesting that temperature is an important driver of temporal variation in these traits.},

In this review, I examine evidence for the occurrence of site familiarity and its fitness benefits, describe the difficulty of measuring site familiarity, note its omission from the influential ideal free and ideal despotic models, and use a literature search to test an assumption of the ideal models that has become widespread in habitat selection theory: that animals behave without regard for site familiarity. I find little support for such "familiarity blindness" in vertebrates. Next I discuss how the study of public information has drawn attention away from site familiarity and point out that both kinds of information are likely to be important in habitat selection. I proceed to examine current models of initial settlement (exploration and settlement of prebreeders on first territories) and optional resettlement (site fidelity or dispersal by established breeders following a period of prospecting) and find that the latter include only basic forms of site familiarity. Hence, I develop the concept that an inhabited space holds a unique "private value" to an animal based on its familiarity with the space and offer a simple model for optional resettlement based on private value that generates several novel predictions, including site fidelity based on cumulative breeding site familiarity and high site fidelity among species with complex territories. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

	Abstract = {Home ranges of animals are associated with the spatial distribution of limiting resources on a landscape, yet no mechanistic models representing this relationship exist. We present models of how animals might choose patches for their home ranges in ways that are optimal with respect to spatially distributed resources. The models assume that animals choose patches for their home ranges based on resource benefits discounted for travel costs. Animals might select patches to maximize resources within their home ranges over random use of the landscape (resource maximization), or to satisfy a minimum resource threshold needed for survival or reproduction (area minimization). We evaluated how landscape configuration structures home ranges of animals by performing individual-based, spatially explicit computer simulations using each model on simulated landscapes that differed only in the spatial continuity of resources among patches (from over-dispersed to clumped). The most important factor determining quality, efficiency, resource content, and spatial distribution of home ranges was the extent to which resources were clumped on a landscape. Characteristics of resource-maximizing home ranges were determined only by the distribution of resources, and differed from those of area-minimizing home ranges depending upon the magnitude of the resource threshold required. An increase in resource threshold increased area and total resource content for area-minimizing home ranges, but did not change their quality or efficiency. Because animals can consume or protect resources within their home ranges, they can depress the value of resources available to other animals and hence how those animals will choose their home ranges. Depression of resource values on a landscape by animals should result in different configuration and spatial distribution of home ranges on a landscape than would be predicted in its absence. We modified the two home range models to depress the value of resources available to other animals within patches selected for each home range. We generated home ranges with the new models on the simulated landscapes and evaluated how home ranges with resource depression varied with landscape configuration and with the Issue of home ranges on the landscape. We compared characteristics and spatial distribution of home ranges with resource depression to those of home ranges that do not. For the Issue of simulations we performed, resource depression resulted in home ranges that differed little in configuration and landscape interactions from those without, except that they were distributed more evenly on the landscapes and overlapped each other less. As the Issue of home ranges on a landscape increased, resource distributions declined in quality and heterogeneity, and home ranges became larger, less efficient, and of lower quality. Our results suggest that, in addition to landscape configuration, the extent to which animals depress resources included in their home ranges should determine the evenness of spatial dispersion, overlap, and home range structure, especially where animals select home ranges to satisfy a specific resource threshold and the density of animals is high. Because resource depression sets a limit on the Issue of home ranges a landscape with fixed resource levels can support, our models provide a means of assessing carrying capacity of a landscape. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {``Home range'' is a standard concept in animal ecology and behavior but few people try to understand what home ranges mean to the animals that have them and often assume that a home-range estimate, quantified using some method, is the home range. This leads to 2 problems. First, researchers put much energy into discerning and using the ``best'' methods for estimating home ranges while no one understands, really, what a home range is. Second, maps delineating home-range estimates may have little connection with what home ranges are and what they mean to the animals that have them. To gain insight into these problems, Roger Powell (hereafter, Roger) documented his own use of space for 65 days, obtaining complete data on where he went, what he did, and how much energy and money he expended and gained in each place. Roger's use of space is consistent with how other mammals use space and, therefore, examination of his data provides insight into what a home range is and how ecologists should approach quantifying other animals' home ranges.We present estimates of Roger's home range in 5 different metrics, or currencies, that provide important and different insights. Home-range estimators that combine different types of information to estimate the spatial distribution and qualities of resources that structure animal behavior (i.e., fitness surfaces) will probably provide the most insight into animals' home ranges. To make reasonable estimates of home ranges, researchers must collect data on habitat, resources, and other attributes of the landscape, so that they can understand basic behaviors of animals and understand how animals may view their environment. We propose that the best concept of a home range is that part of an animal's cognitive map of its environment that it chooses to keep updated.},

	Volume = {96},
	Year = {2015},
	Abstract = {Foraging strategies based on site fidelity and maximization of energy intake rate are two adaptive forces shaping animal behavior. Whereas these strategies can both be evolutionarily stable, they predict conflicting optimal behaviors when population abundance is in decline. In such a case, foragers employing an energy-maximizing strategy should reduce their use of low-quality patches as interference competition becomes less intense for highquality patches. Foragers using a site fidelity strategy, however, should continue to use familiar patches. Because natural fluctuations in population abundance provide the only nonmanipulative opportunity to evaluate adaptation to these evolutionary forces, few studies have examined these foraging strategies simultaneously. Using abundance and space use data from a free-ranging bison (Bison bison) population living in a meadow-forest matrix in Prince Albert National Park, Canada, we determined how individuals balance the trade-off between site fidelity and energy-maximizing patch choice strategies with respect to changes in population abundance. From 1996 to 2005, bison abundance increased from 225 to 475 and then decreased to 225 by 2013. During the period of population increase, population range size increased. This expansion involved the addition of relatively less profitable areas and patches, leading to a decrease in the mean expected profitability of the range. Yet, during the period of population decline, we detected neither a subsequent retraction in population range size nor an increase in mean expected profitability of the range. Further, patch selection models during the population decline indicated that, as density decreased, bison portrayed stronger fidelity to previously visited meadows, but no increase in selection strength for profitable meadows. Our analysis reveals that an energy-maximizing patch choice strategy alone cannot explain the distribution of individuals and populations, and site fidelity is an important evolutionary force shaping animal distribution. Animals may not always forage in the richest patches available, as ecological theory would often predict, but their use of profitable patches is dependent on population dynamics and the strength of site fidelity. Our findings are likewise relevant to applied inquiries such as forecasting species range shifts and reducing human-wildlife conflicts.},

Jones' factors for a series of foodstuffs, including 6.25 as the standard, default conversion factor, have now been used for 75 years. This review provides a brief history of these factors and their underlying paradigm, with an insight into what is meant by "protein." We also review other compelling data on specific conversion factors which may have been overlooked. On the one hand, when 6.25 is used irrespective of the foodstuff, "protein" is simply nitrogen expressed using a different unit and says little about protein (s.s.). On the other hand, conversion factors specific to foodstuffs, such as those provided by Jones, are scientifically flawed. However, the nitrogen:protein ratio does vary according to the foodstuff considered. Therefore, from a scientific point of view, it would be reasonable not to apply current specific factors any longer, but they have continued to be used because scientists fear opening the Pandora's box. But because conversion factors are critical to enabling the simple conversion of determined nitrogen values into protein values and thus accurately evaluating the quantity and the quality of protein in foodstuffs, we propose a set of specific conversion factors for different foodstuffs, together with a default conversion factor (5.6). This would be far more accurate and scientifically sound, and preferable when specifically expressing nitrogen as protein. These factors are of particular importance when "protein" basically means "amino acids," this being the principal nutritional viewpoint. Copyright {\textcopyright} Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies suggest that the growth and fecundity of northern ungulates may be coupled to their summer nutrition. Here, we compare summer dietary nitrogen availability of the five major browse plants (comprising ̃79{\%} of the diet) of moose (Alces alces) in Denali National Park and Nelchina Basin, Alaska, USA. In recent years the productivity of Denali moose has been significantly higher than that of Nelchina moose, prompting this comparison. We examined the phenological progression of leaf nitrogen concentration, tannin-protein precipitation capacity, and digestible protein over three summers in both regions. We then modeled the potential nutritional consequences for a cow moose consuming representative diets on each range, predicting both net protein intake (NPI) and lean body mass accumulation each year. We found that leaf nitrogen and digestible protein decreased, while tannin-protein precipitation capacity increased throughout the summer for all forages. There was 23{\%} more digestible protein in Denali leaves than Nelchina leaves on average, and this difference was significant in all three years. Tannins accounted for a large (mean = 46{\%}) reduction in protein availability, suggesting a key role of these secondary compounds in the nitrogen balance of moose in these regions. Finally, our NPI model predicted that Denali cowswere in positive protein balance 17 days longer than Nelchina cows and accumulated 18 kg more lean body mass over the summer, on average. We conclude that summer dietary nitrogen availability may act as a nutritional constraint on moose and suggest that more emphasis be placed on elucidating its role in population dynamics and conservation of northern ungulates. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

	Abstract = {Habitat selection in ungulates should ensure access to abundant forage of sufficiently high quality. Species living in rugged mountain areas have to face nutritional bottlenecks regularly and should show particularly sophisticated habitat selection behaviour. However, patterns and mechanisms of such adaptations remain little studied. We analysed habitat selection and its seasonal variability of 10 GPS-collared red deer Cervus elaphus living in a topographically challenging landscape of the Swiss Alps. We hypothesised that resource selection by red deer was scale-dependent and predicted that scale-dependence would vary among seasons in relation to seasonal changes of available forage biomass and quality, which we sampled across the entire study area of 250 km2. The studied population of Alpine red deer undertook altitudinal migrations and showed scale-dependent habitat selection that was strongest in winter and declined through spring and summer. Selection occurred mostly at the larger (landscape/home-range location) scale and less so at the smaller (within home-range) scale. Topographic parameters were selected mainly at the landscape scale and mostly in winter. About 70{\%} of all instances of preference for habitat parameters were associated with above-average forage characteristics, represented mostly by higher crude protein content, in a few cases also by higher biomass or both. The overall pattern of space use by red deer characterised by migration and seasonal habitat selection was therefore closely linked to the quality of food resources, although some trade-offs with avoiding human disturbance may also have been involved. {\textcopyright} 2009 Ecography.},

Herbaceous layers alter forest ecosystems by filtering tree species during early stages of tree reproduction and influencing nutrient cycling. Important aspects about how tree species successfully establish below and extend above this ecological filter are unanswered in forest ecology. We experimentally tested the effects of large ungulate carcasses on the filtering function of herbaceous layers. Even well-utilized carcasses created unexpected disturbances that reduced herbaceous cover, which effectively perforated the herbaceous layer filter that can differentially influence tree reproduction. Carcasses also created lasting biogeochemical "hotspots'' in forest soils that may help maintain plant biodiversity by creating resource heterogeneity and shifting competitive relationships. Because the spatial distribution of carcasses is influenced by predators, these data establish an unrecognized link between large carnivores, prey carcasses, and ecosystem processes. This link supports a novel understanding of disturbance by large herbivores in forest ecosystems by demonstrating an important interaction between predator-prey functional traits and tree seedling dynamics on either side of a major ecological filter}}

	Abstract = {Disparities in nutrient content (nitrogen and phosphorus) between herbivores and their plant resources have lately proven to have major consequences for herbivore success, consumer-driven nutrient cycling, and the fate of primary production in ecosystems. Here we extend these findings by examining patterns of nutrient content between animals at higher trophic levels, specifically between insect herbivores and predators. Using a recently compiled database on insect nutrient content, we found that predators exhibit on average 15{\{}{\%}{\}} greater nitrogen content than herbivores. This difference persists after accounting for variation from phylogeny and allometry. Among herbivorous insects, we also found evidence that recently derived lineages (e. g., herbivorous Diptera and Lepidoptera) have, on a relative basis, 15{\{}{\%}{\}}-25{\{}{\%}{\}} less body nitrogen than more ancient herbivore lineages (e. g., herbivorous Orthoptera and Hemiptera). We elaborate several testable hypotheses for the origin of differences in nitrogen content between trophic levels and among phylogenetic lineages. For example, interspecific variation in insect nitrogen content may be directly traceable to differences in dietary nitrogen (including dilution by gut contents), selected for directly in response to the differential scarcity of dietary nitrogen, or an indirect consequence of adaptation to different feeding habits. From some functional perspectives, the magnitude rather than the source of the interspecific differences in nitrogen content may be most critical. We conclude by discussing the implications of the observed patterns for both the trophic complexity of food webs and the evolutionary radiation of herbivorous insects.},

	Abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an "observer" of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging from the collective behaviors oflarge ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

	Abstract = {Animal space use is influenced by many factors and can affect individual survival and fitness. Under optimal foraging theory, individuals use landscapes to optimize high-quality resources while minimizing the amount of energy used to acquire them. The spatial resource variability hypothesis states that as patchiness of resources increases, individuals use larger areas to obtain the resources necessary to meet energetic requirements. Additionally, under the temporal resource variability hypothesis, seasonal variation in available resources can reduce distances moved while providing a variety of food sources. Our objective was to determine if seasonal home ranges of brown bears (Ursus arctos) were influenced by temporal availability and spatial distribution of resources and whether individual reproductive status, sex, or size (i.e., body mass) mediated space use. To test our hypotheses, we radio collared brown bears (n = 32 [9 male, 23 female]) in 2014--2016 and used 18 a priori selected linear models to evaluate seasonal utilization distributions (UD) in relation to our hypotheses. Our top-ranked model by AICc, supported the spatial resource variability hypothesis and included percentage of like adjacency (PLADJ) of all cover types (P {\textless} 0.01), reproductive class (P {\textgreater} 0.17 for males, solitary females, and females with dependent young), and body mass (kg; P = 0.66). Based on this model, for every percentage increase in PLADJ, UD area was predicted to increase 1.16 times for all sex and reproductive classes. Our results suggest that landscape heterogeneity influences brown bear space use; however, we found that bears used larger areas when landscape homogeneity increased, presumably to gain a diversity of food resources. Our results did not support the temporal resource variability hypothesis, suggesting that the spatial distribution of food was more important than seasonal availability in relation to brown bear home range size.},

Locomotory behaviours are physiologically expensive, yet the relative importance of the animal's energetics in determining their home ranges is unknown. It is tested here whether maintenance costs (BMR; basal metabolic rate), energetic capacity (VO2max; maximum metabolic rate) or available energy above self-maintenance (aerobic scope) are related to the size of mammalian home ranges using phylogenetic comparative methods. The first quantitative support for the hypothesis that home-range size is limited by metabolic rates, accounting for variation in body mass, is presented. In particular, the negative effect of BMR, along with the positive effect of VO2max, on home-range size revealed that aerobic scope plays a prominent role in constraining home ranges. These findings suggest optimization of energy allocation where past selection promoted an increase in mobility at the lowest possible body maintenance costs. High aerobic capacity is needed to operate large home ranges. However, in habitats of limited productivity, the associated increase in self-maintenance constrains energy allocation to locomotory behaviours, reinforcing the importance of metabolic processes in ecology.

	Abstract = {Correlations between foliar nutrient concentrations and soil nutrient availability have been found in multiple ecosystems. These relationships have led to the use of foliar nutrients as an index of nutrient status and to the prediction of broadscale patterns in ecosystem processes. More recently, a growing interest in ecological stoichiometry has fueled multiple analyses of foliar nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratios within and across ecosystems. These studies have observed that N:P values are generally elevated in tropical forests when compared to higher latitude ecosystems, adding weight to a common belief that tropical forests are generally N rich and P poor. However, while these broad generalizations may have merit, their simplicity masks the enormous environmental heterogeneity that exists within the tropics; such variation includes large ranges in soil fertility and climate, as well as the highest plant species diversity of any biome. Here we present original data on foliar N and P concentrations from 150 mature canopy tree species in Costa Rica and Brazil, and combine those data with a comprehensive new literature synthesis to explore the major sources of variation in foliar N:P values within the tropics. We found no relationship between N:P ratios and either latitude or mean annual precipitation within the tropics alone. There is, however, evidence of seasonal controls; in our Costa Rica sites, foliar N:P values differed by 25{\%} between wet and dry seasons. The N:P ratios do vary with soil P availability and/or soil order, but there is substantial overlap across coarse divisions in soil type, and perhaps the most striking feature of the data set is variation at the species level. Taken as a whole, our results imply that the dominant influence on foliar N:P ratios in the tropics is species variability and that, unlike marine systems and perhaps many other terrestrial biomes, the N:P stoichiometry of tropical forests is not well constrained. Thus any use of N:P ratios in the tropics to infer larger-scale ecosystem processes must comprehensively account for the diversity of any given site and recognize the broad range in nutrient requirements, even at the local scale.},

	Abstract = {How large herbivores track resource quantity and quality through time has formed the core of an abundance of literature on migratory populations in recent decades. Yet, relating foraging processes and habitat selection patterns in resident populations, where spatial heterogeneity of food resources is fine-grained and/or where the portion of edible plants (i.e. the foodscape) is low, is challenging. We addressed this issue in a mountain population of chamois Rupicapra rupicapra, an intermediate feeder, whose individuals do not migrate. We relied on a rare combination of data on habitat use of 50 GPS-collared females and data on the quantity (biomass) and quality (phenology) of edible resources in their landscape, derived from field sampling of vegetation, remote sensing and diet (DNA barcoding). The foodscape of the chamois was composed of a low proportion of the available biomass ({\textless}18{\%}), including relatively high-quality plants, with low spatial covariation between plant phenology and biomass. Chamois avoided areas with a low edible biomass (where the intake rate may be too low) and focused on areas with plants at approximately the flowering stage, whatever the average plant phenological stage available. Due to this constant preference for flowering plants, home range selection ratios therefore shifted during the summer from a selection of more advanced plants in June to their avoidance in August. When the phenology scores of all plants available, rather than edible plants only, were considered, areas with relatively more advanced plants were selected all summer long. This exemplifies that, when traits from edible plants are different from those of all plants available, it is crucial to consider the actual foodscape to decipher forage and habitat selection processes. By integrating species-specific dimensions of resources in habitat selection studies, we believe understanding of the foraging processes will be improved.},

Females in low quality areas adjusted the size of their home range to include more patches of habitat so that all female deer obtained similar amounts of food resources (total biomass of 6.73$\pm$2.34 tons (mean$\pm$SE) for each home range). Such adjustments of home range size in response to patchiness of resources led to marked between-female variation in home range size. Our results demonstrate that roe deer females have different tactics of habitat use according to spatial variations in habitat quality so that females get similar food resources in highly productive environments such as the Trois Fontaines forest.},

The effect of plants' growing conditions on predatory organisms, feeding one trophic level up, has been much less studied, and there is a general consensus that such effects would be small as herbivores often show relatively strong homeostasis with respect to their nutrient content. Here, we challenge this view, and show from several examples that despite the fact that herbivores buffer much of the variance in nutrient stoichiometry of their food, effects of growing conditions of the primary producers can travel up the food chain. We discuss the implications of these findings, and argue that phosphorus limitation of secondary consumers might be more common in marine than in freshwater systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

	Volume = {80},
	Year = {2011},
	Abstract = {1. Most studies of intraspecific variation in home range size have investigated only a single or a few factors and often at one specific scale. However, considering multiple spatial and temporal scales when defining a home range is important as mechanisms that affect variation in home range size may differ depending on the scale under investigation. 2. We aim to quantify the relative effect of various individual, forage and climatic determinants of variation in home range size across multiple spatiotemporal scales in a large browsing herbivore, the moose (Alces alces), living at the southern limit of its distribution in Norway. 3. Total home range size and core home range areas were estimated for daily to monthly scales in summer and winter using both local convex hull (LoCoH) and fixed kernel home range methods. Variance in home range size was analysed using linear mixed-effects models for repeated measurements. 4. Reproductive status was the most influential individual-level factor explaining variance in moose home range size, with females accompanied by a calf having smaller summer ranges across all scales. Variation in home range size was strongly correlated with spatiotemporal changes in quantity and quality of natural food resources. Home range size decreased with increasing browse density at daily scales, but the relationship changed to positive at longer temporal scales. In contrast, browse quality was consistently negatively correlated with home range size except at the monthly scale during winter when depletion of high-quality forage occurs. Local climate affected total home range size more than core areas. Temperature, precipitation and snow depth influenced home range size directly at short temporal scales. 5. The relative effects of intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of variation in home range size differed with spatiotemporal scale, providing clear evidence that home range size is scale dependent in this large browser. Insight into the behavioural responses of populations to climatic stochasticity and forage variability is essential in view of current and future climate change, especially for populations with thermoregulatory restrictions living at the southern limit of their distribution.},

	Title = {{Control Points in Ecosystems: Moving Beyond the Hot Spot Hot Moment Concept}},
	Volume = {20},
	Year = {2017},
	Abstract = {The phrase ``hot spots and hot moments'' first entered the lexicon in 2003, following the publication of the paper ``Biogeochemical hot spots and hot moments at the interface of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems'' by McClain and others (Ecosystems 6:301--312, 2003). This paper described the potential for rare places and rare events to exert a disproportionate influence on the movement of elements at the scale of landscapes and ecosystems. Here, we examine how the cleverly named hot spot and hot moment concept (hereafter HSHM) has influenced biogeochemistry and ecosystem science over the last 13 years. We specifically examined the extent to which the HSHM concept has: (1) motivated research aimed at understanding how and why biogeochemical behavior varies across spatiotemporal scales; (2) improved our ability to detect HSHM phenomena; and (3) influenced our approaches to restoration and ecosystem management practices. We found that the HSHM concept has provided a highly fertile framework for a substantial volume of research on the spatial and temporal dynamics of nutrient cycling, and in doing so, has improved our understanding of when and where biogeochemical rates are maximized. Despite the high usage of the term, we found limited examples of rigorous statistical or modeling approaches that would allow ecosystem scientists to not only identify, but scale the aggregate impact of HSHM on ecosystem processes. We propose that the phrase ``hot spots and hot moments'' includes two implicit assumptions that may actually be limiting progress in applying the concept. First, by differentiating ``hot spots'' from ``hot moments,'' the phrase separates the spatial and temporal components of biogeochemical behavior. Instead, we argue that the temporal dynamics of a putative hot spot are a fundamental trait that should be used in their description. Second, the adjective ``hot'' implicitly suggests that a place or a time must be dichotomously classified as ``hot or not.'' We suggest instead that each landscape of interest contains a wide range of biogeochemical process rates that respond to critical drivers, and the gradations of this biogeochemical topography are of greater interest than the maximum peaks. For these reasons, we recommend replacing the HSHM terminology with the more nuanced term ecosystem control points. ``Ecosystem control'' suggests that the rate must be of sufficient magnitude or ubiquity to affect dynamics of the ecosystem, while ``points'' allows for descriptions that simultaneously incorporate both spatial and temporal dynamics. We further suggest that there are at least four distinct types of ecosystem control points whose influence arises through distinct hydrologic and biogeochemical mechanisms. Our goal is to provide the tools with which researchers can develop testable hypotheses regarding the spatiotemporal dynamics of biogeochemistry that will stimulate advances in more accurately identifying, modeling and scaling biogeochemical heterogeneity to better understand ecosystem processes.},

	Abstract = {Rates and reactions of biogeochemical processes vary in space and time to produce both hot spots and hot moments of elemental cycling. We define biogeochemical hot spots as patches that show disproportionately high reaction rates relative to the surrounding matrix, whereas hot moments are defined as short periods of time that exhibit disproportionately high reaction rates relative to longer intervening time periods. As has been appreciated by ecologists for decades, hot spot and hot moment activity is often enhanced at terrestrial-aquatic interfaces. Using examples from the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, we show that hot spots occur where hydrological flowpaths converge with substrates or other flowpaths containing complementary or missing reactants. Hot moments occur when episodic hydrological flowpaths reactivate and/or mobilize accumulated reactants. By focusing on the delivery of specific missing reactants via hydrologic flowpaths, we can forge a better mechanistic understanding of the factors that create hot spots and hot moments. Such a mechanistic understanding is necessary so that biogeochemical hot spots can be identified at broader spatiotemporal scales and factored into quantitative models. We specifically recommend that resource managers incorporate both natural and artificially created biogeochemical hot spots into their plans for water quality management. Finally, we emphasize the needs for further research to assess the potential importance of hot spot and hot moment phenomena in the cycling of different bioactive elements, improve our ability to predict their occurrence, assess their importance in landscape biogeochemistry, and evaluate their utility as tools for resource management.},

We test four propositions of spatial and temporal variation in ecosystem properties within a macroscale (1000 km's) extent. We fit Bayesian hierarchical models to thousands of observations from over two decades to quantify four components of variation -- spatial (local and regional) and temporal (local and coherent); and to model their drivers. We found strong support for three propositions: (1) spatial variation at local and regional scales are large and roughly equal, (2) annual temporal variation is mostly local rather than coherent, and, (3) spatial variation exceeds temporal variation. Our findings imply that predicting ecosystem responses to environmental changes at macroscales requires consideration of the dominant spatial signals at both local and regional scales that may overwhelm temporal signals.},

	Abstract = {Research in applied ecology provides scientific evidence to guide conservation policy and management. Applied ecology is becoming increasingly quantitative and model selection via information criteria has become a common statistical modeling approach. Unfortunately, parameters that contain little to no useful information are commonly presented and interpreted as important in applied ecology. I review the concept of an uninformative parameter in model selection using information criteria and perform a literature review to measure the prevalence of uninformative parameters in model selection studies applying Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) in 2014 in four of the top journals in applied ecology (Biological Conservation, Conservation Biology, Ecological Applications, Journal of Applied Ecology). Twenty-one percent of studies I reviewed applied AIC metrics. Many (31.5{\%}) of the studies applying AIC metrics in the four applied ecology journals I reviewed had or were very likely to have uninformative parameters in a model set. In addition, more than 40{\%} of studies reviewed had insufficient information to assess the presence or absence of uninformative parameters in a model set. Given the prevalence of studies likely to have uninformative parameters or with insufficient information to assess parameter status (71.5{\%}), I surmise that much of the policy recommendations based on applied ecology research may not be supported by the data analysis. I provide four warning signals and a decision tree to assist authors, reviewers, and editors to screen for uninformative parameters in studies applying model selection with information criteria. In the end, careful thinking at every step of the scientific process and greater reporting standards are required to detect uninformative parameters in studies adopting an information criteria approach.},

Specifically, foliar elemental, stoichiometric, and phytochemical (ESP) compositions represent key indicator traits. Objectives: Here, we investigate the spatial drivers of foliar ESP at the species level and across species at the trait level for five commonly occurring boreal forest understory plants. Methods: On the island of Newfoundland, Canada, we collected foliar material from four chronosequenced forest grids. Using response variables of foliar elemental (C, N, P, percent and quantity), stoichiometric (C:N, C:P, N:P), and phytochemical (terpenoids) composition, we tested multiple competing hypotheses using spatial predictors of land cover (e.g., coniferous, deciduous, mixedwood), productivity (e.g., enhanced vegetation index), biotic (e.g., stand age/height, canopy closure) and abiotic (e.g., elevation, aspect, slope) factors. Results: We found evidence to support spatial relationships of foliar ESP for most species (mean R2 = 0.22, max = 0.65). Spatial variation in elemental quantity traits of C, N, P were related to land cover along with biotic and abiotic factors for 2 of 5 focal species. Notably, foliar C, C:P, and sesquiterpene traits between different species were related to abiotic factors. Similarly, foliar terpenoid traits between different species were related to a combination of abiotic and biotic factors (mean R2 = 0.26). Conclusions: Spatial-trait relationships mainly occur at the species level, with some commonalities occurring at the trait level. By linking foliar ESP traits to spatial predictors, we can map plant chemical composition patterns that influence landscape-scale ecosystem processes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	Volume = {9},
	Year = {2019},
	Abstract = {Intraspecific variability in ecological traits is widespread in nature. Recent evidence, mostly from aquatic ecosystems, shows individuals differing at the most fundamental level, that of their chemical composition. Age, sex, or body size and condition may be key drivers of intraspecific variability in the body concentrations of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). However, we still have a rudimentary understanding of the patterns and drivers of intraspecific variability in chemical composition of terrestrial consumers, particularly vertebrates. Here, we investigate the elemental composition of the snowshoe hare Lepus americanus. Based on snowshoe hare ecology, we predicted older, larger individuals to have higher concentration of N or P and lower C content compared with younger, smaller individuals. We also predicted females to have higher concentrations of N, P, and lower C than males due to the higher reproductive costs they incur. Finally, we predicted that individuals in better body condition would have higher N and P than those in worse condition, irrespective of age. We obtained C, N, and P concentrations and ratios from a sample of 50 snowshoe hares. We then used general linear models to test our predictions on the relationship between age, sex, body size or condition and stoichiometric variability in hares. We found considerable variation in C, N, and P stoichiometry within our sample. Contrary to our predictions, we found weak evidence of N content decreasing with age. As well, sex appeared to have no relationship with hare body elemental composition. Conversely, as expected, P content increased with body size and condition. Finally, we found no relationship between variability in C content and any of our predictor variables. Snowshoe hare stoichiometry does not appear to vary with individual age, sex, body size, or condition. However, the weak relationship between body N concentration and age may suggest varying nutritional requirements of individuals at different ages. Conversely, body P's weak relationship to body size and condition appears in line with this limiting element's importance in terrestrial ecosystems. Snowshoe hares are keystone herbivores in the boreal forest of North America, and the substantial stoichiometric variability we find in our sample could have important implications for nutrient dynamics, in both boreal and adjacent ecosystems.},

We examined distribution in one of the most common salamanders in southeastern Michigan, the Blue-spotted Salamander (Ambystoma laterale-jeffersonianum unisexual complex). Three major tree species dominate the sub-canopy in the study site and form monospecific patches, which may have an effect on the distribution of terrestrial phases of local amphibian species. To examine this, we tested whether adult salamanders are significantly associated negatively or positively with patches of particular tree species. We then examined two potential causal factors: habitat quality, using leaf litter macroinvertebrate biomass as a proxy, and behavioral site choice in the Blue-spotted Salamander. We found that this species is positively associated with patches of red maple and negatively associated with patches of black cherry. We also found that, when presented with a choice, salamanders choose red maple leaf litter over black cherry leaf litter. In the absence of differences in physical leaf litter characteristics between patches of red maple and black cherry, we suggest that the Blue-spotted Salamander may be utilizing chemical cues to select habitat. Our findings imply that salamander populations may be affected not only by habitat loss, but also by changes in forest composition. These results provide evidence for a more complex model than the traditional amphibian metapopulation concept, where even fully forested habitat may form a matrix of optimal and sub-optimal, or even intolerable, patches.},

	Volume = {75},
	Year = {2006},
	Abstract = {1. Although the home range is a fundamental ecological concept, there is considerable debate over how it is best measured. There is a substantial literature concerning the precision and accuracy of all commonly used home range estimation methods; however, there has been considerably less work concerning how estimates vary with sampling regime, and how this affects statistical inferences. 2. We propose a new procedure, based on a variance components analysis using generalized mixed effects models to examine how estimates vary with sampling regime. 3. To demonstrate the method we analyse data from one study of 32 individually marked roe deer and another study of 21 individually marked kestrels. We subsampled these data to simulate increasingly less intense sampling regimes, and compared the performance of two kernel density estimation (KDE) methods, of the minimum convex polygon (MCP) and of the bivariate ellipse methods. 4. Variation between individuals and study areas contributed most to the total variance in home range size. Contrary to recent concerns over reliability, both KDE methods were remarkably efficient, robust and unbiased: 10 fixes per month, if collected over a standardized Issue of days, were sufficient for accurate estimates of home range size. However, the commonly used 95{\%} isopleth should be avoided; we recommend using isopleths between 90 and 50{\%}. 5. Using the same Issue of fixes does not guarantee unbiased home range estimates: statistical inferences differ with the Issue of days sampled, even if using KDE methods. 6. The MCP method was highly inefficient and results were subject to considerable and unpredictable biases. The bivariate ellipse was not the most reliable method at low sample sizes. 7. We conclude that effort should be directed at marking more individuals monitored over long periods at the expense of the sampling rate per individual. Statistical results are reliable only if the whole sampling regime is standardized. We derive practical guidelines for field studies and data analysis.},

	Abstract = {1. Selection of prey in poor body condition allegedly is a widespread phenomenon in predator-prey systems. Yet, it remains unclear to what extent such selection reflects impeded prey escape ability due to severe malnutrition and/or state-dependent risk taking following lesser changes in prey body condition. In systems where prey food availability is adequate, few individuals should be severely malnourished and thus condition-sensitive predation should be related principally to changes in nutritional status that occur irrespective of an individual's absolute body condition. 2. I studied predation in snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus, Erxleben) when food was abundant, to test the prediction that change in body condition would contribute, more than would absolute body condition, to vulnerability to predation. Hares (n = 618) were radio-marked and monitored for survival while body condition was indexed during bimonthly livecaptures. A subsample of animals (n = 36) was equipped with motion- sensitive transmitters and activity patterns were examined in relation to the body con- dition index and vulnerability to predation. 3. Manipulation of hare nutritional status via food supplementation improved hare body condition but did not affect vulnerability to predation; reduction of nematode parasite Issues did not improve hare condition but reduced predation among female hares. Reproductive status affected predation in both sexes, with recently pregnant females and non-scrotal males being less vulnerable to predation. Heavier males also tended to experience lower predation rates. 4. Predation rates for both female and male hares were higher among individuals having recently experienced condition deterioration but not among animals considered to be in poor absolute condition. Yet, the parameter representing change in condition was the last to enter survival models, indicating a relatively modest effect of this factor on hare vulnerability to predation. Mammalian but not avian predators tended to kill hares in declining condition, and hare activity patterns were not correlated either to change in condition or to survival. 5. These findings indicate that nutritional status may influence vulnerability to preda- tion even when food is abundant, but that such effects occur indirectly through changing body condition. This implies that hares are likely to forage in a risk-prone manner when subject to worsening condition.},

	Abstract = {The second edition of this book is unique in that it focuses on methods for making formal statistical inference from all the models in an a priori set (Multi-Model Inference). A philosophy is presented for model-based data analysis and a general strategy outlined for the analysis of empirical data. The book invites increased attention on a priori science hypotheses and modeling.Kullback-Leibler Information represents a fundamental quantity in science and is Hirotugu Akaike's basis for model selection. The maximized log-likelihood function can be bias-corrected as an estimator of expected, relative Kullback-Leibler information. This leads to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and various extensions. These methods are relatively simple and easy to use in practice, but based on deep statistical theory. The information theoretic approaches provide a unified and rigorous theory, an extension of likelihood theory, an important application of information theory, and are objective and practical to employ across a very wide class of empirical problems.The book presents several new ways to incorporate model selection uncertainty into parameter estimates and estimates of precision. An array of challenging examples is given to illustrate various technical issues.This is an applied book written primarily for biologists and statisticians wanting to make inferences from multiple models and is suitable as a graduate text or as a reference for professional analysts.},

	Volume = {36},
	Year = {2013},
	Abstract = {The influence of habitat quality and population density on occupancy dynamics may surpass that of traditional metrics of area and isolation, but often this is not considered explicitly in studies of spatially structured populations. In landscapes that are not easily characterized as binary habitat/non-habitat (e.g. variegated landscapes), this influence may be even more important and occur at both local and landscape levels. It follows that occupancy dynamics may be driven by disparate processes depending on how extinction or colonization relate to habitat quality and population density. We examined the relative influence of area, structural isolation, habitat quality, local population density, and neighborhood population density (i.e. population density in the landscape around a site) on the probability of extinction and colonization of snowshoe hare Lepus americanus across an expansive forest mosaic landscape (encompassing the northern third of Idaho). Habitat quality and population density were highly influential in determining extinction and colonization, whereas patch area and isolation were much less important. Sites with heavier vegetative cover at the site or landscape-level were more likely to be colonized and less likely to go extinct, and sites with greater local population density in the previous time step had lower probability of extinction. Sites embedded in high density neighborhoods also were less likely to go extinct, but not more likely to be colonized. We found a significant interaction between local and neighborhood population density on extinction in 1 yr, suggesting that the strength of demographic rescue may vary dependent on local site densities. Our results add to a growing literature showing that factors outside of structural metrics of area and isolation are important drivers of occupancy dynamics. Given the multi-scaled influence of habitat quality and population density on occupancy dynamics, our work also indicates that research on snowshoe hare must extend beyond simply assessing local factors to understand the spatial dynamics of populations.},

Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere.

	Abstract = {Animals concentrate their activities within areas we call home ranges because information about places increases fitness. Most animals, and certainly all mammals, store information about places in cognitive maps---or neurally encoded representations of the geometric relations among places---and learn to associate objects or events with places on their map. I define the value of information as a time-dependent increment it adds to any appropriate currency of fitness for an informed versus an uninformed forager, and integrate it into simple conceptual models that help explain movements of animals that learn, forget, and use information. Unlike other space-use models, these recognize that movement decisions are based on an individual's imperfect and ever-changing expectancies about the environment---rather than omniscience or ignorance. Using simple, deterministic models, I demonstrate how the use of such dynamic information explains why animals use home ranges, and can help explain diverse movement patterns, including systematic patrolling or ``traplining,'' shifting activity or focal areas, extra-home-range exploration, and seemingly random (although goal-directed and spatially contagious) movements. These models also provide insights about interindividual spacing patterns, from exclusive home ranges (whether defended as territories or not) to broadly overlapping or shared ranges. Incorporating this dynamic view of animal expectancies and information value into more-complex and realistic movement models, such as random-walk, Bayesian foraging, and multi-individual movement models, should facilitate a more comprehensive and empirical understanding of animal space-use phenomena. The fitness value of cognitive maps and the selective exploitation of spatial information support a general theory of animal space use, which explains why mammals have home ranges and how they use them.},

According to the habitat productivity -- home-range size hypothesis, we expected home-range size and movement rate to be negatively correlated with the proportion of food-rich habitat types in home ranges. Food availability influenced space use, but the effect was more pronounced at the small scale (i.e., movement rates) than at the large scale (i.e., home-range sizes) and during winter than summer.

	Abstract = {The size of an individual's home range is an important feature, influencing reproduction and survival, but it can vary considerably among both populations and individuals. The factors accounting for such variation are still poorly understood, and comprehensive long-term field studies considering various environmental factors that influence home range size are rare. We investigated the effects of seasonality, availability of food, cover, Issue of direct neighbours and the relative individual body mass on home range sizes in 125 adult female striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, in South Africa from 2004 to 2008. We used radiotelemetry to estimate home range sizes, trapping to determine the Issue of direct neighbours, and plant surveys in every home range to determine availability of food and cover. Home ranges were smaller when food quantity was high, many territorial neighbours were present, females had a relatively small body mass and during the nonbreeding season. We conclude that the availability of food resources and intraspecific competition are the main factors influencing home range size in female striped mice. Females enlarged their home ranges when territorial neighbours were few, and there was a significant positive correlation between home range size and quantity of food plants. This indicates that home range size might not reflect the minimal trade-off between access to resources that allow for a female's survival and lowest cost for defending and foraging in that area. Instead, we propose a hypothesis for future research that female striped mice occupy areas several times larger than needed to improve their fitness by providing resources for future offspring. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

We develop a model that predicts the mass-related energy budgets and limits of carnivore size within these groups. We show that the transition from small to large prey can be predicted by the maximization of net energy gain; larger carnivores achieve a higher net gain rate by concentrating on large prey. However, because it requires more energy to pursue and subdue large prey, this leads to a 2-fold step increase in energy expenditure, as well as increased intake. Across all species, energy expenditure and intake both follow a three-fourths scaling with body mass. However, when each dietary group is considered individually they both display a shallower scaling. This suggests that carnivores at the upper limits of each group are constrained by intake and adopt energy conserving strategies to counter this. Given predictions of expenditure and estimates of intake, we predict a maximum carnivore mass of approximately a ton, consistent with the largest extinct species. Our approach provides a framework for understanding carnivore energetics, size, and extinction dynamics.},

	Abstract = {The spatial scale of animal space use, e.g. measured as individual home range size, is a key trait with important implications for ecological and evolutionary processes as well as management and conservation of populations and eco-systems. Explaining variation in home range size has therefore received great attention in ecological research. However, few studies have examined multiple hypotheses simultaneously, which is important provided the complex inter-actions between life history, social system and behaviour. Here, we review previous studies on home range size in ungulates, supplementing with a meta-analysis, to assess how differences in habitat use and species charac-teristics affect the relationship between body mass and home range size. Habitat type was the main factor explaining interspecific differences in home range size after accounting for species body mass and group size. Species using open habitats had larger home ranges for a given body mass than species using closed habitats, whereas species in open habitats showed a much weaker allometric relationship compared with species living in closed habitats. We found no support for relationships between home range size and species diet or mating system, or any sexual differences. These patterns suggest that the spatial scale of animal movement mainly is a combined effect of body mass, group size and the landscape structure. Accordingly, landscape management must acknowledge the influence of spatial distribution of habitat types on animal behaviour to ensure natural processes affecting demography and viability of ungulate populations.},

However, the current methodology used to identify asymptotes for home-range area curves is largely subjective and varies between studies. Our objective was to evaluate the use of exponential, Gompertz, logistic, and reciprocal function models as a means for identifying asymptotes of home-range area curves. We radio monitored northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) coveys during mid-September through November 2001-2002 in Jim Hogg County, Texas. We calculated home-range size of radiomarked coveys using the 95{\%} fixed kernel with least squares cross validation and minimum convex polygon estimators. We fitted area observations and coefficient of variation to the Issue of locations using exponential, Gompertz, logistic, and reciprocal function models to estimate the minimum Issue of locations necessary to obtain a representative home range size for each home range estimator. The various function models consistently provided a relatively good fit for home range area curves and coefficient of variation curves (0.58 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.99; P {\textless} 0.05) for both home range estimators. We used an information-theoretic framework (AICC) to select the best model to estimate area-curve asymptotes. The use of function models appears to provide a structured and useful approach for calculating area-curve asymptotes. We propose that researchers consider the use of such models when determining asymptotes for home-range area curves and that more research be conducted to validate the strength of this method.},

McNab (1963) plotted home-range size (HR) against body weight (BW) for a variety of mammal species, and concluded that home-range size was determined by an animal's energetic needs and by the density of available food. Using a regression model, he fitted an allometric relationship of the form HR = a * BWb. The value of the exponent (b) was close to 0.75, the value which relates basal metabolic rate to body weight (Kleiber 1961). McNab (1963) also divided the species in his sample into two dietetic categories, "hunters" and "croppers," and showed that the allometric coefficient (a) was higher among the hunters, a finding he attributed to the relatively low density of their preferred food items. Since then, similar relationships have been revealed in other taxa (lizards: Turner et al. 1969; birds: Schoener 1968; Armstrong 1965; mammalian carnivores: Gittleman and Harvey 1982; primates: Milton and May 1976; Clutton-Brock and Harvey 1977; Harvey and Clutton-Brock 1981; and mammals in general: Harestad and Bunnell 1979) where variation in both a and b have been noted. In particular, exponents tend to be higher than McNab originally documented. Jenkins (1981) has recently summarized some of these data in an attempt to compare the scaling of home-range on body weight for various bird and mammal taxa. However, simple comparison of exponents may be rather uninformative since correlations for most of the relationships are weak, and confidence limits for the slopes therefore wide. If, as McNab (1963) suggested, home-range size is determined by energy needs, then consistent differences in the metabolic requirements of similar-sized birds and mammals should lead to differences in the scaling relationships of home-range size and body size in the two groups. In this paper, metabolic rate, home-range size, and dietary data from bird and mammal species are used to address the following questions: (1) Does the relationship between daily energy expenditure and body weight differ between birds and mammals? (2) Does daily energy expenditure directly determine home-range size?},

	Abstract = {Home range size is a fundamental concept for understanding animal dispersion and ecological needs, and it is one of the most commonly reported ecological attributes of free-ranging mammals. Previous studies indicate that red foxes Vulpes vulpes display great variability in home range size. Yet, there has been little consensus regarding the reasons why home range sizes of red foxes vary so extensively. In this study, we examine possible causes of variation in red fox home range sizes using data from 52 GPS collared red foxes from four study areas representing a gradient of landscape productivity and human landscape alteration in Norway and Sweden. Using 90{\%} Local Convex Hull home range estimates, we examined how red fox home range size varied in relation to latitude, elevation, vegetation zone, proportion of agricultural land and human settlement within a home range, and sex and age. We found considerable variation in red fox home range sizes, ranging between 0.95 km2 to 44 km2 (LoCoH 90{\%}) and 2.4 km2 to 358 km2 (MCP 100{\%}). Elevation, proportion of agricultural land and sex accounted for 50{\%} of the variation in home range size found amongst foxes, with elevation having the strongest effect. Red foxes residing in more productive landscapes (those in more southern vegetation zones), had home ranges approximately four times smaller than the home ranges of foxes in the northern boreal vegetation zone. Our results indicate that home range size was influenced by a productivity gradient at both the landscape (latitude) and the local (elevation) scale. The influence of the proportion of agriculture land on home range size of foxes illustrates how human landscape alteration can affect the space use and distribution of red foxes. Further, the variation in home range size found in this study demonstrates the plasticity of red foxes to respond to changing human landscape alteration as well as changes in landscape productivity, which may be contributing to red fox population increases and northern range expansions.},

	Abstract = {Although many studies employ allometric relationships to demonstrate possible dependence of various traits on body mass, the relationship between home range size and body mass has been perhaps the most difficult to understand. Early studies demonstrated that carnivorous species had larger home ranges than herbivorous species of similar mass. These studies also argued that scaling relations (e.g., slopes) of the former were steeper than those of the latter and explained this in terms of the distribution of food resources, which are more uniformly distributed for most herbivores than for carnivores. In contrast to these studies, we show that scaling relations of home ranges for carnivorous mammals do not differ significantly from those of herbivorous and omnivorous species and that all three exhibit slopes that are significantly steeper than predicted on the basis of energetic requirements. We also demonstrate that home range size is constrained to fit within a polygonal constraint space bounded by lines representing energetic and/or biophysical limitations, which suggests that the log-linear relationship between home range area and mass may not be the appropriate function to compare against the energetically predicted slopes of 0.75 or 1.0. It remains unclear, however, why the slope of the relationship between home range area and body mass, whether based on raw data or on constraint lines, always exceeds that predicted by the energetic needs hypothesis.},

Female flying squirrels occupied home ranges with a greater abundance of snags than did males. We suggest that females moved into areas with an abundance of potential dens and relatively low food resources while rearing young in response to competition for maternal dens, or to avoid contact with other squirrels.

	Abstract = {Background: Space use by animals is determined by the interplay between movement and the environment, and is thus mediated by habitat selection, biotic interactions and intrinsic factors of moving individuals. These processes ultimately determine home range size, but their relative contributions and dynamic nature remain less explored. We investigated the role of habitat selection, movement unrelated to habitat selection and intrinsic factors related to sex in driving space use and home range size in Iberian ibex, Capra pyrenaica. We used GPS collars to track ibex across the year in two different geographical areas of Sierra Nevada, Spain, and measured habitat variables related to forage and roost availability. Results: By using integrated step selection analysis (iSSA), we show that habitat selection was important to explain space use by ibex. As a consequence, movement was constrained by habitat selection, as observed displacement rate was shorter than expected under null selection. Selection-independent movement, selection strength and resource availability were important drivers of seasonal home range size. Both displacement rate and directional persistence had a positive relationship with home range size while accounting for habitat selection, suggesting that individual characteristics and state may also affect home range size. Ibex living at higher altitudes, where resource availability shows stronger altitudinal gradients across the year, had larger home ranges. Home range size was larger in spring and autumn, when ibex ascend and descend back, and smaller in summer and winter, when resources are more stable. Therefore, home range size decreased with resource availability. Finally, males had larger home ranges than females, which might be explained by differences in body size and reproductive behaviour. Conclusions: Movement, selection strength, resource availability and intrinsic factors related to sex determined home range size of Iberian ibex. Our results highlight the need to integrate and account for process dependencies, here the interdependence of movement and habitat selection, to understand how animals use space. This study contributes to understand how movement links environmental and geographical space use and determines home range behaviour in large herbivores.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT Aim Mammalian home range patterns provide information on spatial behaviour and ecological patterns, such as resource use, that is often used by conservation managers in a variety of contexts.However, there has been little research on home range patterns outside of the terrestrial environment, potentially limiting the rel- evance of current home range models for marine mammals, a group of particular conservation concern. To address this gap, we investigated how variation in mam- malian home range size among marine and terrestrial species was related to diet, environment and body mass. Location Global. Methods We compiled data on home range size, environment (marine and ter- restrial), diet and body mass from the literature and empirical studies to obtain a dataset covering 462 mammalian species. We then used phylogenetic regression analyses (to address non-independence between species) to examine the relative contribution of these factors to variation of home range size among species. Results Body size explained the majority of the difference in home range size among species (53--85{\%}), with larger species occupying larger home ranges. The type of food exploited by species was also an important predictor of home range size (an additional 15{\%} of variation), as was the environment, but to amuch lesser degree (1.7{\%}). Main conclusions The factors contributing to the evolution of home ranges are more complex than has been assumed.We demonstrate that diet and body size both influence home range patterns but differ in their relative contribution, and show that colonization of the marine environment has resulted in the expansion of home range size. Broad-scale models are often used to informconservation strategies.We propose that future integrative models should incorporate the possibility of phylogenetic effects and a range of ecological variables, and that they should include species representative of the diversity within a group},

Widely used methods of determining preference from measurements of usage and availability depend critically on the array of components that the researcher, often with a degree of arbitrariness, deems available to the animal. This paper proposes a new method, based on ranks of components by usage and by availability. A virtue of the rank procedure is that it provides comparable results whether a questionable component is included or excluded from consideration. Statistical tests of significance are given for the method. The paper also offers a hierarchical ordering of selection processes. This hierarchy resolves certain inconsistencies among studies of selection and is compatible with the analytic technique offered in this paper.},

	Abstract = {It is widely recognized that the stoichiometry of nutrient elements in phytoplankton varies within the ocean. However, there are many conflicting mechanistic explanations for this variability, and it is often ignored in global biogeochemical models and carbon cycle simulations. Here we show that globally distributed particulate P:C varies as a linear function of ambient phosphate concentrations, whereas the N:C varies with ambient nitrate concentrations, but only when nitrate is most scarce. This observation is consistent with the adjustment of the phytoplankton community to local nutrient availability, with greater flexibility of phytoplankton P:C because P is a less abundant cellular component than N. This simple relationship is shown to predict the large-scale, long-term average composition of surface particles throughout large parts of the ocean remarkably well. The relationship implies that most of the observed variation in N:P actually arises from a greater plasticity in the cellular P:C content, relative to N:C, such that as overall macronutrient concentrations decrease, N:P rises. Although other mechanisms are certainly also relevant, this simple relationship can be applied as a first-order basis for predicting organic matter stoichiometry in large-scale biogeochemical models, as illustrated using a simple box model. The results show that including variable P:C makes atmospheric CO2 more sensitive to changes in low latitude export and ocean circulation than a fixed-stoichiometry model. In addition, variable P:C weakens the relationship between preformed phosphate and atmospheric CO2 while implying a more important role for the nitrogen cycle.},

However, our understanding of variation in day range across species is limited. Here we present a day range model and compare predictions against a comprehensive analysis of mammalian day range. As found in previous studies, day range scales near the 1/4 power of body mass. Also, consistent with model predictions, taxonomic groups differ in the way day range scales with mass, associated with the most common diet types and foraging habitats. Faunivores have the longest day ranges and steepest body mass scaling. Frugivores and herbivores show intermediate and low scaling exponents, respectively. Day range in primates did not scale with mass, which may be consistent with the prediction that three-dimensional foraging habitats lead to lower exponents. Day ranges increase with group size in carnivores but not in other taxonomic groups.},

Yet we lack an understanding of how the spatial patterns in organismal stoichiometry affect biogeochemical processes and the tools to predict the impacts of global changes on biogeochemical processes. In this contribution we develop stoichiometric distribution models (StDMs), which allow us to map spatial structure in resource elemental composition across a landscape and evaluate spatial responses of consumers. We parameterise StDMs for a consumer-resource (moose-white birch) system and demonstrate that we can develop predictive models of resource stoichiometry across a landscape and that such models could improve our predictions of consumer space use. With results from our study system application, we argue that explicit consideration of the spatial patterns in organismal elemental composition may uncover emergent individual, population, community and ecosystem properties that are not revealed at the local extents routinely used in ecological stoichiometry. We discuss perspectives for further developments and application of StDMs to advance three emerging frameworks for spatial ecosystem ecology in an era of global change; meta-ecosystem theory, macroecological stoichiometry and remotely sensed biogeochemistry. Progress on these emerging frameworks will allow for the integration of ecological stoichiometry and individual space use and fitness.},

	Abstract = {Although defence against herbivores is often argued to be the main action of plant secondary metabolites (PSMs), very few examples have demonstrated that intraspecific variation in PSM concentrations influences foraging by wild vertebrate herbivores. Experiments with captive animals often indicate that PSM concentrations influence how much herbivores eat from individual plants, but these experiments do not replicate the subtle trade-offs in diet selection faced by wild animals, which must avoid predators and extremes of weather, interact with conspecifics, and achieve a balanced, nutritious diet, while avoiding intoxication by PSMs. We characterized the foliar chemistry of every tree from two Eucalyptus species available to a population of koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) and considered rates of tree visitation over a ten-year period. We show that visitation rate was most strongly influenced by tree size, but that koalas also visited trees less frequently if the foliage contained either high concentrations of deterrent PSMs known as formylated phloroglucinol compounds, or low concentrations of nitrogen. Consequently, plant chemistry restricts the use of trees by this herbivore, and thus limits the food available to koalas and potentially influences koala populations.},

	Abstract = {Most forests in Europe are patchily distributed within the agricultural landscape. Therefore, forest biogeochemistry in Europe cannot be understood without considering the connectivity of nutrient cycles between forest patches and fertilized cropland. In this paper, we quantified the role of roe deer, the most widespread wild ungulate in Europe, as a vector of nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilized fields to forest patches, in a typical agricultural landscape of southwestern Europe. We derived a model of nutrient transfer from a data set on deer density, landscape-use by individual deer, and nutrient content in feces. The model shows that the magnitude of nutrient transfer is highly sensitive to the proportion of forest patches within the landscape, and to the way deer use the landscape to feed and defecate. Hence, the magnitude of nutrient transfer varies substantially across the landscape. Locally, deer may significantly fertilize the forest, transferring the equivalent of almost 20{\%} of the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen, and the equivalent of 0.13{\%} of the total stock of phosphorus from cropland to forest patches each year. These inputs may markedly influence the biogeochemistry of forests in the long run, and the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio available to trees and forest plants. These results highlight the significant, but, heterogeneous, role of wild ungulates in forest biogeochemistry across Europe. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

This hypothesis was tested interspecifically using zooplankton taxa with different specific growth rates and intraspecifically using different ontogenetic stages within single species. Among all five species, growth rate was positively correlated with {\%}N and {\%}P and negatively correlated with N:P. However, {\%}N increased only from similar to 8{\%} to similar to 9{\%} while {\%}P varied fourfold across the observed range of growth rates, indicating that changes in {\%}P drive the negative relationship between growth rate and N:P. Intraspecific comparisons showed that growth rate was positively related to {\%}P and negatively related to N:P for Daphnia lumholtzi, but growth rate was unrelated to {\%}P and N:P for D. magna and D. oblusa. Mean {\%}P, {\%}N, and N:P differed significantly among Daphnia spp. and among populations of Scapholebris mucronata and Bosmina longirostris. These data strongly support the growth rate hypothesis as an explanation for differences in body N:P in zooplankton and indicate that the biological stoichiometry of a rapid growth rate life-history is phosphorus intensive.},

Differences in availability of the elements in the environment was the major driver of variation. Variability between leaves within a plant or between individuals of the same genotype growing in close proximity was as large as variability between genotypes. Elements could be grouped by influence on growth: N, P, S and Mn concentrations follow each other and increase with growth rate; K, Ca and Mg uptake follow the increase in biomass; but uptake of Fe, B, Zn and Al seems to be limited. The position of Cu lies between the first two groups. Only for Na is there a difference in element concentrations between genotypes.

	Abstract = {1. Herbivores make decisions at different spatial levels in response to food plant quality and quantity. Although experiments have examined the responses of herbivores at lower levels, few have examined how herbivores respond to such variation at the stand level. We assessed the response of a herbivore community in a boreal forest to manipulations of food resources at the stand level by performing a large replicated experiment where we fertilized young forest stands and then followed their use by herbivores during the subsequent year.2. We used stands at 25 sites in an area 35 × 45 km. At each site we had one fertilized plot, a close control (100 m away) and a distant control (300 m away), all 50 × 50 m.3. Before the growing season we fertilized treatment plots with calcium--ammonium--nitrate at 600 kg ha−1 (200 kg N ha−1). Fertilization significantly improved browse quality (nitrogen concentration) in both downy birch Betula pubescens and Scots pine Pinus sylvestris. Furthermore, the amount of browse significantly increased for birch, and Scots pine showed a similar trend.4. Considering the animal community as a whole, we found that 10 of 13 animal species/groups made more tracks during winter in fertilized than in control plots. The total Issue of tracks was greater in fertilized plots, followed by close and then distant controls.5. In the summer following fertilization, moose Alces alces strongly selected fertilized plots over controls. Furthermore, during the following winter moose again selected fertilized plots over controls. Hares Lepus timidus similarly left more pellets in the fertilized plots. Other mammals used the fertilized and the close controls similarly, and both were used more than distant controls. The Issue of grouse pellets did not differ among the treatments, although they followed a similar trend.6. Several lines of evidence suggest that moose browsed fertilized plots more. Although not statistically significant, both heavy and light browsing were more common in fertilized than in control plots. Trees with the top shoot removed, or with bark stripped from the stem, did not differ significantly, but once again fertilized plots were browsed more than controls.7. Our results are discussed in light of understanding both how herbivores in general respond to changes in food quality and quantity, and if fertilization may be a useful tool in modern forestry to manage herbivores.8. Fertilization might be useful as a tool to alter the location of herbivore feeding, but buffer strips around any fertilized areas appear necessary, and other potential environmental effects should be evaluated.},

	Abstract = {The content and ratio of nutrients in plants can be constrained by a wide array of factors, including nutrient supply, light intensity, herbivory, infection or intrinsic growth rate and can, in turn, affect many ecosystem processes including photosynthesis, decomposition, resource limitation and nutrient cycling. Studies of plant stoichiometry and stoichiometric homeostasis have focused primarily on the role of nutrient supply as a constraint on plant tissue chemistry, yet recent work suggests that local plant diversity, plant species composition and consumers may change the nutrient composition of whole plant communities. By experimentally removing insects, foliar fungi and soil fungi from a long-term experiment manipulating plant diversity, we found that the foliar stoichiometry of individual plant species depends on biotic context. Local plant diversity and the composition of the consumer community each altered foliar tissue carbon and nutrient chemistry of four different grassland species. The greatest impacts of consumers on foliar chemistry occurred at low plant diversity, and these changes induced by altering the food web were of a similar magnitude to the effects of fertilization or drought found in previous work. Consumers and plant diversity acted primarily on foliar carbon and nitrogen, whereas changes in foliar phosphorus were associated with the productivity of the local plant community. Thus, changes in whole-community stoichiometry that have been documented in response to alterations of the consumer food web or plant community are underlain by stoichiometric changes in individual species as well as plant species compositional changes. Synthesis. These results suggest a new pathway by which loss of consumer or plant diversity may significantly impact the wide variety of ecosystem processes that depend on foliar nutrient content.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n},

	Volume = {9},
	Year = {2014},
	Abstract = {Nutrient balance is a strong determinant of animal fitness and demography. It is therefore important to understand how the compositions of available foods relate to required balance of nutrients and habitat suitability for animals in the wild. These relationships are, however, complex, particularly for omnivores that often need to compose balanced diets by combining their intake from diverse nutritionally complementary foods. Here we apply geometric models to understand how the nutritional compositions of foods available to an omnivorous member of the order Carnivora, the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos L.), relate to optimal macronutrient intake, and assess the seasonal nutritional constraints on the study population in west-central Alberta, Canada. The models examined the proportion of macronutrients that bears could consume by mixing their diet from food available in each season, and assessed the extent to which bears could consume the ratio of protein to non-protein energy previously demonstrated using captive bears to optimize mass gain. We found that non-selective feeding on ungulate carcasses provided a non-optimal macronutrient balance with surplus protein relative to fat and carbohydrate, reflecting adaptation to an omnivorous lifestyle, and that optimization through feeding selectively on different tissues of ungulate carcasses is unlikely. Bears were, however, able to dilute protein intake to an optimal ratio by mixing their otherwise high-protein diet with carbohydrate-rich fruit. Some individual food items were close to optimally balanced in protein to non-protein energy (e.g. Hedysarum alpinum roots), which may help explain their dietary prevalence. Ants may be consumed particularly as a source of lipids. Overall, our analysis showed that most food available to bears in the study area were high in protein relative to lipid or carbohydrate, suggesting the lack of non-protein energy limits the fitness (e.g. body size and reproduction) and population density of grizzly bears in this ecosystem.},

Although the preva- lence of these items was low, with sun spiders recorded in nine and scorpion remains in one of 246 scats, our observations suggest that aardwolves opportunisti- cally feed on larger prey than previously thought. However, our observations do not suggest that aardwolves utilized these large prey items as alterna- tives to their main food resource during periods of food scarcity. Therefore, we suggest that the adaptive advantages of such opportunism may be small, but that the observed behavioural plasticity could be advantageous under specific environmental conditions and therefore is maintained as a behavioural trait.},

They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial freshwater and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in "established use." Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},

	Volume = {25},
	Year = {2015},
	Abstract = {An important asset for the management of wild ungulates is recognizing the spatial distribution of forage quality across heterogeneous landscapes. To do so typically requires knowledge of which plant species are eaten, in what abundance they are eaten, and what their nutritional quality might be. Acquiring such data, however, may be difficult and time consuming. Here, we are proposing a rapid and cost-effective forage quality monitoring tool that combines near infrared (NIR) spectra of fecal samples and easily obtained data on plant community composition. Our approach rests on the premise that NIR spectra of fecal samples collected within low population density exclosures reflect the optimal forage quality of a given landscape. Forage quality can thus be based on the Mahalanobis distance of fecal spectral scans across the landscape relative to fecal spectral scans inside exclosures (referred to as DISTEX). The Gi* spatial autocorrelation statistic can then be applied among neighboring DISTEX values to detect and map ?hot spots? and ?cold spots? of nutritional quality over the landscape. We tested our approach in a heterogeneous boreal landscape on Anticosti Island (Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada), where white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations over the landscape have ranged from 20 to 50 individuals/km2 for at least 80 years, resulting in a loss of most palatable and nutritious plant species. Our results suggest that hot spots of forage quality occur when old-growth balsam fir stands comprise {\textgreater}39.8{\%} of 300 ha neighborhoods, whereas cold spots occur in laggs (i.e., transition zones from forest to peatland). In terms of ground-level indicator plant species, the presence of Canada bunchberry (Cornus canadensis) was highly correlated with hot spots, whereas tamarack (Larix laricina) was highly correlated with cold spots. Mean DISTEX values were positively and significantly correlated with the neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent lignin contents of feces. While our approach would need more independent field trials before it is fully validated, its low cost and ease of execution should make it a valuable tool for advancing both the basic and applied ecology of large herbivores.},

	Volume = {8},

	Abstract = {For most animals, the ability to regulate intake of specific nutrients is vital to fitness. Recent studies have demonstrated nutrient regulation in nonhuman primates over periods of one observation day, though studies of humans indicate that such regulation extends to longer time frames. Little is known about longer-term regulation in nonhuman primates, however, due to the challenges of multiple-day focal follows. Here we present the first detailed study of nutrient intake across multiple days in a wild nonhuman primate. We conducted 30 consecutive all day follows on one female chacma baboon (Papio hamadryas ursinus) in the Cape Peninsula of South Africa. We documented dietary composition, compared the nutritional contribution of natural and human-derived foods to the diet, and quantified nutrient intake using the geometric framework of nutrition. Our focus on a single subject over consecutive days allowed us to examine daily dietary regulation within an individual over time. While the amounts varied daily, our subject maintained a strikingly consistent balance of protein to non-protein (fat and carbohydrate) energy across the month. Human-derived foods, while contributing a minority of the diet, were higher in fat and lower in fiber than naturally-derived foods. Our results demonstrate nutrient regulation on a daily basis in our subject, and demonstrate that she was able to maintain a diet with a constant proportional protein content despite wide variation in the composition of component foods. From a methodological perspective, the results of this study suggest that nutrient intake is best estimated over at least an entire day, with longer-term regulatory patterns (e.g., during development and reproduction) possibly requiring even longer sampling. From a management and conservation perspective, it is notable that nearly half the subject's daily energy intake derived from exotic foods, including those currently being eradicated from the study area for replacement by indigenous vegetation.},

	Abstract = {Adequate nutrition is a fundamental requirement for the maintenance and growth of populations, but complex interactions between nutrients and plant toxins make it difficult to link variation in plant quality to the ecology of wild herbivores. We asked whether a 'foodscape' model of habitat that uses near-infrared spectroscopy to describe the palatability of individual trees in the landscape, predicted the foraging decisions of a mammalian browser, the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). Specifically, we considered four behavioural decision points at which nutritional quality may influence an animal's decision. These were: which tree to enter, whether to feed from that tree, when to stop eating, and how long to remain in that tree. There were trends for koalas to feed in eucalypt trees that were more palatable than unvisited neighbouring conspecific trees, and than trees that they visited but did not eat. Koalas ate longer meals in more palatable trees, and stayed longer and spent more time feeding per visit to these trees. Using more traditional chemical analyses, we identified that an interaction between the concentrations of formylated phloroglucinol compounds (a group of plant secondary metabolites) and available N (an integrated measure of tannins, digestibility and N) influenced feeding. The study shows that foodscape models that combine spatial information with integrated measures of food quality are a powerful tool to predict the feeding behaviour of herbivores in a landscape.},

	Abstract = {Nutritional geometry has shown the benefits of viewing nutrition in a multidimensional context, in which foraging is viewed as a process of balancing the intake and use of multiple nutrients. New insights into nutrient regulation have been generated in studies performed in a laboratory context, where accurate measures of amounts (e.g. eaten, converted to body mass, excreted) can be made and analysed using amounts-based nutritional geometry. In most field situations, however, proportional compositions (e.g. of foods, diets, faeces) are the only measures readily available, and in some cases are more relevant to the problem at hand. For this reason, a complementary geometric method was recently introduced for analysing multi-dimensional data on proportional compositions in nutritional studies, called the right-angled mixture triangle (RMT). We use literature data from field studies of primates to demonstrate how the RMT can provide insight into a variety of important concepts in nutritional ecology. We first compare the compositions of foods, using as an example primate milks collected in both the wild and the laboratory. We next compare the diets of different species of primates from the same habitat and of the same species (mountain gorillas) from two distinct forests. Subsequently, we model the relationships between the composition of gorilla diets in these two habitats and the foods that comprise these diets, showing how such analyses can provide evidence for active nutrient-specific regulation in a field context. We provide a framework to relate concepts developed in laboratory studies with field-based studies of nutrition.},

	Abstract = {This study examined the literature in ISI Web of Science to identify the effects that the main drivers of global change have on the nutrient concentrations and C:N:P stoichiometry of organisms and ecosystems, and examined their relationship to changes in ecosystem structure and function. We have conducted a meta-analysis by comparing C:N:P ratios of plants and soils subjected to elevated [CO 2] with those subjected to ambient [CO 2]. A second meta-analysis compared the C:N:P ratios of plants and soils that received supplemental N to simulate N deposition and those that did not receive supplemental N. On average, an experimental increase in atmospheric [CO 2] increased the foliar C:N ratios of C3 grasses, forbs, and woody plants by 22{\%}, but the foliar ratios of C4 grasses were unaffected. This trend may be enhanced in semi-arid areas by the increase in droughts that have been projected for the coming decades which can increase leaf C:N ratios. The available studies show an average 38{\%} increase in foliar C:P ratios in C3 plants in response to elevated atmospheric [CO 2], but no significant effects were observed in C4 grasses. Furthermore, studies that examine the effects of elevated atmospheric [CO 2] on N:P ratio (on a mass basis) are warranted since its response remains elusive. N deposition increases the N:P ratio in the plants of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, and decreases plants and organic soil C:N ratio (25{\%} on average for C3 plants), reducing soil and water N 2 fixation capacity and ecosystem species diversity. In contrast, in croplands subjected to intense fertilization, mostly, animal slurries, a reduction in soil N:P ratio can occur because of the greater solubility and loss of N. In the open ocean, there are experimental observations showing an ongoing increase in P-limited areas in response to several of the factors that promote global change, including the increase in atmospheric [CO 2] which increases the demand for P, the warming effect that leads to an increase in water column stratification, and increases in the N:P ratio of atmospheric inputs. Depending on the type of plant and the climate where it grows, warming can increase, reduce, or have no effect on foliar C:N ratios. The results suggest that warming and drought can increase C:N and C:P ratios in warm-dry and temperate-dry terrestrial ecosystems, especially, when high temperatures and drought coincide. Advances in this topic are a challenge because changes in stoichiometric ratios can favour different types of species and change ecosystem composition and structure. {\textcopyright} 2011 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.},

In this study, we tested quantitative predictions of the ES ?minimal model? for the growth rates of two tadpole species (wood frogs, Lithobates sylvaticus and American toads, Anaxyrus americanus), by manipulating light and the quality of a leaf litter mixture in a seminatural mesocosm experiment. We predicted that wood frogs, which consume leaf litter as a resource, would respond more strongly to leaf litter quality than toads, which forage on periphyton and algae. The ES minimal model, parameterized from literature values, provided strikingly accurate quantitative predictions of nonlinear wood frog growth patterns across gradients of leaf litter quality, both in this experiment and when applied to previously published data on wood frog growth responses to various leaf litter species. In contrast, toad growth was best explained by the biomass of periphyton, which was driven primarily by light availability and only indirectly influenced by litter-derived soluble polyphenols. This study demonstrates the power of ES to predict organism growth rates, and highlights potential applications of this theory to predicting population- and community-level responses to changing forest environments.},

	Abstract = {The chemical quality of forage may determine landscape use and habitat quality for some herbivorous species. However, studies that investigate the relationship between foliar chemistry and foraging choices in wild vertebrates are rare. Petauroides volans (the greater glider) is unique among Australian marsupial folivores because it glides. It also frequently consumes foliage from both major Eucalyptus subgenera, Eucalyptus (common name "monocalypt") and Symphyomyrtus (common name "symphyomyrtle"), which differ markedly in their foliar chemistry. Such differences are thought to be a product of co-evolution that also led to guild-specific plant secondary metabolite (PSM) specialization among other marsupial eucalypt folivores. To explore whether foliar chemistry influences tree use, we analyzed foliage from eucalypt trees in which we observed P. volans during a radio tracking study and from eucalypt trees in which animals were never observed. We used a combination of chemical assays and near infrared spectrophotometry (NIRS) to determine concentrations of nitrogen (N), in vitro available nitrogen (AvailN), and in vitro digestible dry matter (DDM) from foliage sampled from the monocalypt and symphyomyrtle species, and total formylated phloroglucinol compounds (FPCs) and sideroxylonals (a class of FPCs) from the symphyomyrtle species (FPCs do not occur in monocalypts). Tree size and spatially-dependent, intraspecific variations in sideroxylonals and DDM concentrations in the symphyomyrtle foliage and of N, AvailN, and DDM in the monocalypt species were important indicators of tree use and habitat suitability for P. volans. The results i) demonstrate that guild-specific PSMs do not always lead to guild-specific foraging; ii) provide a compelling co-evolutionary case for the development of gliding in P. volans; and iii) have implications for the management and conservation of this and other folivorous species.},
